MANNING: The makers or Bromo Quinine Cold Tablets bring you another adventure of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson.

(Pause)

 When you are threatened with a cold remember this: Bromo Quinine tablets are made expressly for the relief of colds. They are not a cure-all. They are made for one thing and one thing only and that is the relief of colds. Isn't it better to take a preparation that has only one use rather than one that has half a dozen uses? Insure yourself the advantages of specialized medication. When you feel a cold coming on, take Bromo Quinine tablets.

(Pause)

And now, here we are, seated once more in Doctor Watson's study. The good doctor is wandering aimlessly about the room - tidying objects on his desk - straightening a row of books. Well, Dr. Watson - you certainly have a passion for law and order.

WATSON: A place for everything, and everything in it, place, I always say. I do hate a mess. Holmes on the contrary was one of the untidiest men that ever drove a fellow lodger to desperation. When I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal scuttle -- his tobacco in the end of a Persian slipper -- and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife in the very center of the wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs.

MANNING: (Laughs) And or course that annoyed Sherlock Holmes. 

WATSON: He never even noticed it. Well, now let me see - last time I think I promised that this week's story would be the "The Musgrave Ritual."

MANNING: "The Musgrave Ritual" -- what was that? 

WATSON: Patience, Mr. Manning - patience. Well, as I was saying, Holmes was very untidy. Our chambers were always full of chemicals and criminal relics -- but his papers were my greatest trial. He had a horror of destroying documents. Once a year or so, I would browbeat him into docketing and cataloguing them. One winter night, as we sat together by the fire -- Holmes playing casual chords on his violin -- I ventured to suggest that he might spend his time more profitably by making our sitting room a little more habitable.

MUSIC: VIOLIN ONLY

WATSON: I say, Holmes -- I wish you'd stop that caterwauling.

HOLMES: Hmpf!

MUSIC: VIOLIN CONTINUES

WATSON: Oh -- stop that racket -- why don=t you do something worth while -- instead of lolling around like that?

VIOLIN STOPS

HOLMES: For instance ?

WATSON: Well -- ah - -well you could straighten up this room. It looks more like a pig sty every day.

HOLMES: Oh, very well - (yawns)

SOUND FX: FOOTSTEPS FADING 


WATSON : Now where are you going?

SOUND FX: DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS

WATSON: Look at the place - papers on the table - papers on the

floor - papers on all the chairs -- papers ...

SOUND FX: DOOR OPENS

SOUND FX: TRUNK PULLED ACROSS THE FLOOR AND SET DOWN WITH A THUD

WATSON: What are you doing Holmes - pulling that large tin box in here?

HOLMES: House cleaning -- the key? Oh yes...

SOUND FX: BOX UNLOCKED

WATSON: What have you got in there?

HOLMES: Cases - records of some of my earlier cases -- done -- ah -- prematurely. (Laughs) -- before I had such a competent biographer. I think if you knew what I had in this box, you'd ask me to pull some out, instead of putting others in. 

WATSON: It's no use, Holmes - you can't get 'round me like that. You might just as well begin putting your stuff away.

HOLMES: Hmm -- here=s the record of the Tarleton murders...the case of Varnberry --

WATSON: Hmph --

HOLMES: The adventure of the Russian woman - and the singular affair of the aluminum crutch.

WATSON: Aluminum crutch?

HOLMES: Yes -- a most amazing story -- it was one April day -- the rain was coming down in torrents...

WATSON: I'm not interested.

HOLMES: Heigh ho -- well, I suppose I'd best get to work. Ah -- here -- now here really is something a little recherche. 

WATSON: Bah - it=s nothing but a wooden box with a sliding lid.

HOLMES: But look inside - look inside. 

SOUND FC: LID SLIDES OPEN

WATSON: Hmmm - a crumpled piece of paper - with some doggerel written on it - an old fashioned brass key - a peg of wood with a ball of string attached, and three rusty old discs of metal -- not very impressive.

HOLMES: Well -- what do you make of it?

WATSON: It's a strange collection.

HOLMES: And there is a stranger story connected with it.

WATSON: Hmph -- I suspected these relics had a history.

HOLMES: They are history, my dear Watson - they are history.

WATSON: What was it about?

HOLMES: These are all I have left to remind me of the Musgrave Ritual - fascinating 

case -- fascinating. Heigh ho -- well, I guess I'd better be getting on with my work.

WATSON: Er- - what was the Musgrave Ritual?

HOLMES: You want to interrupt my labors with a silly story -- dear, dear -- and leave all this litter as it is reprehensible, my dear Watson - thoroughly reprehensible.

WATSON: Oh -- get on with the story.

HOLMES: Very well -- it was one of my first cases -- when I was making a most precarious living out of my sleuthing. It had to do with Reginald Musgrave -- a scion of one of the oldest families in the Kingdom. Well, I hadn't seen Reginald Musgrave for several years -- until one morning I received a note from him. Here it is.

WATSON: (Reads) "My dear Sherlock: I hear that you are turning to practical ends these powers with which you used to analyze us. Could you spare time to visit us at Hurlstone? I can promise you a problem which will tax even your nimble wits. Hopefully yours, Reggie Musgrave."

HOLMES: You can imagine my eagerness. In my innermost heart, I believed that I could succeed where others had failed. 

WATSON: Conceit.

HOLMES; Don't interrupt, Watson, don't interrupt. Well, late that night -- I arrived at Hurlstone -- to find myself enthusiastically greeted by mine host.

MUSIC: BRIDGE TO NEXT SCENE

MUSGRAVE: Well, Holmes -- delighted to see you, my dear fellow. It's awfully good of you to come. You've gotten taller and thinner than ever.

HOLMES: You=re much the same I should say, Musgrave. 

MUSGRAVE: Alfred, carry Mr. Holmes= bags up to his room. 

ALFRED: Yes sir --

HOLMES: Your -- ah - butler is new at his job, isn't he? 

MUSGRAVE: Yes -- but how did you know?

HOLMES: His uniform is rather a bad fit -- and his legs are- better suited to the stable yard than the drawing room. 

MUSGRAVE: Well, as a matter of fact -- he's just been promoted to his post. He used to be the head coachman. It's about Brunton -- our old butler -- that I wanted to see you. 

HOLMES: What about him?

MUSGRAVE: He's disappeared.

HOLMES: Brunton's disappeared, eh? Seems to me I've heard you mention his name before.

MUSGRAVE: I dare say you have. He's been in service here for nearly twenty years -- although he's barely forty, now. 

HOLMES: Rather unusual.

MUSGRAVE: Yes. He was a young school teacher out of a place when he was first taken up by my father. He was a man of great ability -- handsome, spoke several languages, and played every musical instrument. A paragon -- Brunton had only one fault.

HOLMES: Yes?

MUSGRAVE: He was a bit of a Don Juan -- a few months ago, we were in hope that he was about to settle down for he became engaged to Rachel Howells, our second maid.

HOLMES: Well?

MUSGRAVE: Well, he has since thrown her over, and taken up with the daughter of the head gamekeeper.

HOLMES: And what was this girl - ah - Rachel like? 

MUSGRAVE: Rachel is a very good girl - but of an excitable Welsh temperament - she had a touch of brain fever -- subsequent to the smashup of her romance. I'm really rather worried about the girl.

HOLMES: Yes, but look here, Musgrave -- you haven=t brought me all the way from London to discuss a servant girl's love affairs?

MUSGRAVE: That was our first drama at Hurlstone, and quite a tempest in a teapot it was, you know what country houses are like. But a second one came to drive it from our minds -- and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of the butler, Brunton.

HOLMES: Dismissal?

MUSGRAVE: One night last week -- Thursday to be exact, I found that I couldn't sleep -- you know how it is. Well, at two o'clock I rose and lit a candle, intending to get a novel I had been reading in the library. I pulled on my dressing gown and started down the stairs. Imagine my surprise when, looking down the corridor I saw a glimmer of light coming from the library door. My first thought was of burglars... Luckily our corridors are liberally decorated with trophies and old weapon. I seized a battle axe in either hand and tiptoed down the passage to the library door.

MUSIC: BRIEF BRIDGE TO NEXT SCENE

MUSGRAVE: Don't move -- if you value your life.

BRUNTON: Oh, sir --

MUSGRAVE: Why -- why -- God bless me - it's Brunton! What are you doing down here in the middle of the night?

BRUNTON: Well, you see sir -- I --

MUSGRAVE: And my desk has been broken into - and my private papers strewn on the table -- what do you mean by going through my private papers? You scoundrel -- after the trust we=ve had in you.

BRUNTON: Well, sir -- I meant no harm.

MUSGRAVE: The impudence -- the rank impudence. Brunton -- you will leave my service tomorrow.

BRUNTON: Oh, Mr. Musgrave, sir -- I can't bear the disgrace. I've always been proud about my station in life.

MUSGRAVE: Yes, and look what it has led you into!

BRUNTON: The disgrace will kill me. At least let me give you notice, and leave in a month's time - as if it was of my own free will.

MUSGRAVE: Very well - but a month is too long. Take yourself off in a week - and give what reasons you wish for going. 

BRUNTON: Only a week? Oh no -- a fortnight -- at least say a fortnight.

MUSGRAVE: A week -- and you've been let off very lightly. Now put down that paper you have in your hand, and get out.

MUSIC: BRIDGE TO NEXT SCENE

HOLMES: And after that little set-to -- you were too annoyed to sleep -- eh, Musgrave?

MUSGRAVE: Well, as a matter of fact -- I did spend the rest of the night thinking of things I should have said to the fellow -- however, by morning I had calmed down somewhat.

HOLMES: And Brunton?

MUSGRAVE: For two days afterwards, Brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties. On the third day, he was gone. 

HOLMES: Gone? Gone where?

MUSGRAVE: Deuce take it -- that's what I would like to know. His bed had not been slept in -- but all our windows and doors were found locked on the inside and no one had let him out.


HOLMES: Did you question this girl -- ah -- Rachel?

MUSGRAVE: Yes -- she's been very ill ever since his disappearance -- sometimes hysterical. I had to have a nurse to sit up with her at night.

HOLMES: What was the condition of Brunton's room -- after the disappearance?

MUSGRAVE: Very orderly -- as usual. His clothes -- his watch -- even his money were in the room, but the black suit he usually wore was missing. His slippers, too were gone -- but not his boots.

HOLMES: Enlightening -- most enlightening. And what was the paper he had in his hand when you surprised him in the library? 

MUSGRAVE: It was the Musgrave Ritual.

HOLMES: The Musgrave Ritual? What is that?

MUSGRAVE: Oh rather an absurd business. It has only it's antiquity to excuse it. It's a strange sort of catechism which each Musgrave must answer when he becomes of age.

HOLMES: Could I see it?

MUSGRAVE: Certainly -- certainly. It's in the library -- come this way.

SOUND FX: FOOTSTEPS

HOLMES: Hmm -- this old hall is rather impressive with all its armor and weapons. Wait! I fancy I heard someone on the stairs -- someone on tiptoe.

MUSGRAVE: I'll run up and have a look. 

SOUND FX: STEPS UP STAIRS, RECEDING

HOLMES: Be careful -- my dear fellow -- be careful. 

MUSGRAVE: (In distance) No -- there's no one here.

HOLMES: Strange -- I would have sworn I heard footsteps.

SOUND FX: STEPS DOWN STAIRS, APPROACHING

MUSGRAVE: Must have been the old stairs creaking. This is the library and this is the desk where I keep my private papers. 

HOLMES: How private? I mean -- is there anything there that would benefit anyone else?

MUSGRAVE: Good heavens - no.

HOLMES: Nothing that might lead to blackmail?

MUSGRAVE: (Laughs) No -- sorry to disappoint you, Holmes. But I've led a very tame and uninteresting life.

HOLMES: (Laughs) I see one of the drawers was broken into -- very amateurish -- I'm afraid Brunton had very little experience

MUSGRAVE: Yes - that lock is completely damaged. I've moved everything to this side of the desk. Just a minute till I find my key. Ah -- yes --

SOUND FX: DRAWER OPENS

MUSGRAVE: And here is the Musgrave Ritual.

HOLMES: Hmm -- curious old writing -- it dates back to -- ah -- Charles the First I should say. You can tell by the spelling. 

MUSGRAVE: Probably Charles the Second -- my ancestor Ralph Musgrave was a prominent cavalier and right hand man in Charles' wanderings. They went in for rigamarolle of this sort in those days. It's just a series of questions and answers. Probably the bywords of a secret society.

HOLMES: You know the answers by heart, I take it. 

MUSGRAVE: Yes -- it's something every Musgrave has to learn.

HOLMES: Suppose I read off the questions -- and you give me the answers.

MUSGRAVE: Fire away -- you can't trip me up there. 

HOLMES: All right -- here goes. Whose was it? 

MUSGRAVE: His who is gone.

HOLMES: Who shall have it? 

MUSGRAVE: He who will come. 

HOLMES: Where was the sun? 

MUSGRAVE: Over the oak. 

HOLMES: Where was the shadow? 

MUSGRAVE: Under the Elm.


HOLMES: How was it stepped?

MUSGRAVE: North by ten - and by ten - east by five, and by five -south by two, and by two - west by one, and by one - and so under.

HOLMES: What shall we give for it?

MUSGRAVE: All that is ours.

HOLMES: Why should we give it?

MUSGRAVE: For the sake of the trust. As you can see, Holmes -- the paper has no practical importance.

HOLMES: On the contrary, it has tremendous practical importance. Your butler seems to have been a very clever fellow. He has had more insight than ten generations of his masters.

MUSGRAVE: I say, Holmes --

HOLMES: The oak I take it is the one that stands here -- to the east of the house. I noticed it as I drove up.

MUSGRAVE: That's right -- you can see it from this window.

HOLMES: Yes -- quite a patriarch.

MUSGRAVE: It must have been here when the ritual was drawn up.

HOLMES: It was there at the Norman Conquest in all probability. Listen! There is someone in the hall outside -- eavesdropping. I'm sure of it this time.

MUSGRAVE; I'll soon find --

SOUND FX: QUICK FOOTSTEPS

MUSGRAVE: Hello, why it's Rachel! My dear girl -- whatever are you doing up and

about like this? Where's your nurse?

RACHEL: (Whispers feverishly) She -- she'=s sleeping -- I fooled her.

MUSGRAVE: You must go right back to bed.

RACHEL: Yes, I must go right back. He's gone.

MUSGRAVE: Yes, of course.

RACHEL: Brunton's gone --he's gone I say --

MUSGRAVE: Yes, yes -- I know that -- now don't worry -- we'll find him for you. Just go back.

RACHEL: You'll never find him -- never--I know where he's gone.

HOLMES: Yes?

RACHEL: He's gone where he belongs.

HOLMES: Where is that?

RACHEL: To hell -- he's gone to hell - (laughs)

MUSGRAVE: I say -- she's delirious -- help me to get her upstairs, will you? We'll have to postpone our talk I'm afraid.

HOLMES: Yes -- there's nothing more to do until tomorrow morning in any case.

MUSGRAVE: What do you mean tomorrow morning?

HOLMES: When the sun is over the oak.

RACHEL: That's what he said -- and now he's gone -- gone. (LAUGHS)

MUSIC: THEME UP AND PLAY TO END.

MANNING: In just a moment we will rejoin Sherlock Holmes as he endeavors to solve the mystery of the Musgrave Ritual. 

A cold, even a so-called slight cold, is something to be concerned about. For any cold, as you very well know, may quickly take a more serious turn. Be serious in your treatment of a cold. At the very first symptom, take a serious and proven preparation.

They give you that multiple action you want. Don't fool around when you feel a cold coming on. Take warning at the first symptom and take Bromo Quinine tablets. Bromo Quinine tablets are sold by all drugstores, a few cents a box. Ask clearly and firmly for Bromo - B R O M O--Quinine -- Q U I N I N E -- Bromo Quinine cold tablets!

MUSIC: THEME UP AND PLAY AS BRIDGE TO SECOND ACT.

MUSGRAVE: Good morning, Holmes - I hope you haven't been too bored prowling around the grounds by yourself. Sorry to have kept you waiting for breakfast. Fact is, I'm a bit upset. There's been another disappearance. Rachel eluded her nurse again last night, and so far, she hasn't been found. 

HOLMES: So I understand. Your now butler told me. I've traced her foot-prints to the edge of this lake.

MUSGRAVE: But the lake is over eight feet deep at this point. Oh, the poor demented girl!

HOLMES: I took the liberty of ordering the drags and grappling hooks at once.

MUSGRAVE: Yes. I see the men working. Have you found -- 

HOLMES: Nothing -- exactly nothing -- hello, there seems to be some excitement now. The drags have caught on something. 

MAN: (In distance) We've got 'er -- sir -- we've got 'er this time for sure.

MUSGRAVE: Pull hard boys --

SOUND FX: SLOSH OF WATER

MUSGRAVE: That's right -- what a frightful business. Hello -- why, why -- it's not a body!

HOLMES: No, it's a large canvas bag.

MUSGRAVE: (Fading in) Here, boys -- give it to me.

MAN: Yes sir. 

HOLMES: What's in it?

MUSGRAVE: Just a minute. Don't slosh it around so --

SOUND FX: TINKLING SOUND

MUSGRAVE: Why - why it's just a lot of old discolored metal and some dull colored pebbles or glass. Bah! Throw it back in.

HOLMES: Stop! Better keep that stuff - bring it along - and don't let it out of your hands. Now let's get back to the house.

MUSGRAVE: Breakfast - eh?

HOLMES: No, breakfast will have to be postponed. The sun is now over the oak.

MUSGRAVE: I say, Holmes - you're not taking that rubbish seriously?

HOLMES: The only thing that puzzles me is the absence of our ancient elm tree.

MUSGRAVE: Sorry to disappoint you. There are plenty of elderly beeches - won't they do?

HOLMES: No. I'm afraid not.

MUSGRAVE: Wait a minute - there used to be an elm - very ancient it was, too - over there - you can still see the stump. It was cut down when I was about fifteen.

HOLMES: Hmm - that's better - midway between the house and the oak. Yes - that must have been the one. I suppose it's impossible to find out how tall it was. 

MUSGRAVE: Not at all. It was sixty four feet.

HOLMES: Excellent! But how in --

MUSGRAVE: That tree was my tutor's favorite exercise in trigonometry.

HOLMES: Now then - the shadow of the oak is fairly obvious - we can see that for ourselves - but the shadow of the elm is a bit more difficult.

MUSGRAVE: I say, Holmes - what are you doing with that fishing rod?

HOLMES: A fishing rod of six feet -- throws a shadow -- of -- ah -- let me see -- nine feet exactly. Quite simple. Therefore, a tree of sixty-four feet will throw a shadow of ninety six feet - and in the same direction. Where's my tape? Ah, yes -- ninety six feet -- ninety-six yes, here we are.

MUSGRAVE: I must say, Holmes that's very neat.

HOLMES: That's just the beginning -- my dear fellow -- just the beginning -- north ten and ten -- ten steps by each foot I think that means.

MUSGRAVE: That takes you parallel to the well of the old wing of the house.

HOLMES: Marked with a peg -- now five to the east- - yes, and two to the South.

MUSGRAVE: I say - it takes you to that old unused door.

HOLMES: The old unused door has been used quite recently. The surrounding ivy is all torn.

MUSGRAVE: Yes, by Jove - it's even unlocked.

HOLMES: How long since this wing has been inhabited?

MUSGRAVE: Not for several generations. It's the oldest part of the house - built in the sixteenth century, I should say. It's only used nowadays to store things in.

HOLMES: Open the door.

SOUND FX: DOOR CREAKS

HOMES: Two paces to the west obviously means two paces down this flag stone passage.

SOUND FX: FOOTSTEPS ON STONE

HOLMES: Well, this must be the place indicated by the ritual.

SOUND FX: TAPPING ON STONE

MUSGRAVE: What are you tapping the stones for?

HOLMES: All firmly cemented together -- not even a hollow sound! 

MUSGRAVE: I told you it was all Balderdash.

HOLMES: Hold on -- "And so under" -- I nearly forgot that one. Is there a cellar under this place?

MUSGRAVE: Yes, it's as old as the house.

HOLMES: Lead me to it -- that's where our search ends. 

MUSGRAVE: Very well -- but what are we searching for?

SOUND FX: FOOTSTEPS ON STONE

MUSGRAVE: Careful -- steps here - it's pretty dark.

(Echo On)

MUSGRAVE: That's it - this is the cellar - we store wood down here sometimes. Hello - it=' all been moved to the side.

HOLMES: What's this - what's this?

MUSGRAVE: It's Brunton's muffler -- what's the villain been doing down here?

HOLMES: Just as I thought. Look here - this piece of wood - it's been used to prop up something heavy. See how both ends are flattened.

MUSGRAVE: Look - the muffler's attached to this iron ring - set in the flagstone.

HOLMES: Quite sizeable flagstone, eh? He must have had some one to help him. He couldn't raise that by himself.

MUSGRAVE: You mean Brunton?

HOLMES: Yes - he was after the buried treasure. He probably talked Rachel into assisting him -- that's how she happened to be in possession of the bag she threw into the lake.

MUSGRAVE: I don't understand what you're talking about. 

HOLMES: Hmmm - I can't budge it. Lend a hand, will you Musgrave? 

MUSGRAVE: Righto -- ugh -- ugh - there it comes.

SOUND FX: SCRAPE OF STONE

SOUND FX: CREAK OF HINGES

HOLMES: Quick - prop it up with that piece of wood

SOUND FX: THUD

HOLMES: That's it --


MUSGRAVE: By Jove -- it's -- it's a small room down there -- and there on the side -- what's that?

HOLMES: That my dear Musgrave - is what Brunton was after. Come on -- let's go down.

SOUND FX: JUMPING DOWN TO STONE FLOOR

MUSGRAVE: A brass bound wooden box - all covered with dust and worm eaten. The lid has been thrown back. Look here, Holmes -I thought you expected to find a considerable treasure. All this trunk contains is a few discolored discs of metal -- old coins apparently. I say, do you think that rascal Brunton has been here and robbed me?

HOLMES: That was his intention undoubtedly, but I don't think he succeeded.

MUSGRAVE: Why not? The box is empty.

HOLMES: Because I think I see his feet sticking out from behind the box. Here -- help me move the box.

SOUND FX: BOX SCRAPES ON FLOOR

MUSGRAVE: It's Brunton alright -- he's -- he's dead!

HOLMES: Quite. Suffocated, I fancy -- this cubbyhole isn't very large.

MUSGRAVE: Yes, but how -- how did it happen?

HOLMES: He was murdered on the second night -- after you discovered him in the library. I can reconstruct the scene fairly easily from the data we have on hand -- Rachel's condition -- the bag found in the lake -- the open door -- the muffler -- and the piece of wood used as a prop. It is the last which is particularly significant He had talked Rachel into assisting him -- realizing that the girl was still infatuated They waited until everyone had gone to bed -- then stole down here. It was a stormy night I believe----

RACHEL: I do - you know I do! I'd do anything for you!

BRUNTON: Well, then come along -- down this stairway -- easy!

(Echo on)

RACHEL: But it -- it's stealing.

BRUNTON: Stealing? To take something a man doesn't even know he has? He'll never miss it.

RACHEL: But it's his -- not ours.

BRUNTON: What of it -- he hasn't the sense to find it -- has he? I'm the only one has enough brains for that, Think I want to spent the rest of my life waiting on them that aren't as good as I am? - We'll have money - we'll be rich! Why do you think I didn't marry you before? Because I wasn't making enough. Think I'm going to starve myself to keep a wife?

RACHEL: Then you will marry me if -- if we find it?

BRUNTON: Here's the ring -- wait I'll pull my muffler through it. 

RACHEL: But you will marry me -- you must. I haven't told you before because I didn't want to worry you, but folks are beginning to suspect and I can't --

RACHEL: You -- you haven't answered me. 

BRUNTON: Haven't answered what?

RACHEL: You are going to marry me, aren't you?

BRUNTON: Marry you -- (laughs) What kind of a fool do you take me for? Marry a girl like you that lets a fellow -- (laughs)

BRUNTON: How do I know I'm the only lover you've had! A wench like you -- (laughs)

RACHEL: I hate you! I hate you! I hate the sight of you! I don't ever want to see you again!

(Echo off)

MUSIC: BRIDGE TO NEXT SCENE

MUSGRAVE: I say, Holmes -- what a cad he must have been. 

HOLMES: Quite.

MUSGRAVE: But, what did Brunton find that he considered so valuable? 

HOLMES: The contents of that bag.

MUSGRAVE: This old rubbish! Why, the metal is almost black and these dull looking stones --

HOLMES: Try rubbing one of them -- that reddish one, for instance.

MUSGRAVE: Righto -- I say, I say - it develops quite a sparkle. 

HOLMES: Quite - I imagine that stuff was left in your ancestors' possession by the royal party on the death of Charles first. I congratulate you on its discovery. It is of great intrinsic value but of even greater importance as a historical curiosity.

MUSGRAVE: Why, what is it then?

HOLMES: It is nothing less than the ancient crown of the Kings of England!

MUSIC: BRIDGE TO NEXT SCENE

MANNING: That's an exciting discovery, Doctor Watson. How did it happen that Charles the Second never recovered his crown? 

WATSON: That is the one point Holmes was unable to clear up. It is likely that the Musgraves who held the secret died in the interval, and by some oversight left this guide to his descendants without explaining the meaning of it.

MANNING: Dr. Watson will be back in just a moment to tell us about next week's adventure. 

(PAUSE)

MANNING: There are all kinds of things being offered for the treatment of colds. But remember this: Bromo Quinine tablets are made solely for the relief of colds. They don't pretend to do half a dozen things. They claim to do only one thing and do it well -- and that is relieve a cold's distress. Furthermore, Bromo Quinine cold tablets are a proven preparation. They have been the standby of millions for years. Use your head when a cold threatens and take a preparation whose merit has been conclusively proven. Don't fall for fly-by-night preparations or medicines that claim the world. Thousands -- yes, millions of men and women endorse your judgment when you take Bromo Quinine cold tablets. Every drugstore in the land sells those famous tablets at a few cents a box. The minute you feel a cold coming On make your way to a drugstore and say: "Bromo Quinine cold tablets, please."

And now, what story are we to have next week, Doctor Watson?

WATSON: Suppose I tell you the one Holmes calls "The Adventure Of The Three Garriddebs."

MANNING: Garridebs? What on earth are Garridebs?

WATSON: (Laughing) It's a family name, Mr. Manning -- and the story is concerned with a gentleman called Garrideb, who wished to find others of the same name -- for rather curious reasons.

MUSIC: SIGNATURE MUSIC UP AND THEN LOWER FOR NEXT PARAGRAPH

MANNING: You have been listening to a Sherlock Holmes adventure adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story, "The Musgrave Ritual" with Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, and Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson. The dramatization was by Edith Meiser. This program is presented from Hollywood every week at this same time by the makers of Bromo Quinine Cold tablets - quick relief for colds.

This is Knox Manning speaking.

MUSIC: UP AND PLAY TO END.

BOB CAMPBELL (Announcer): Petri Wine brings you...

MUSIC: THEME. FADE ON CUE:

CAMPBELL: Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

MUSIC: THEME ... FULL FINISH

CAMPBELL: The Petri family--the family that took the time to bring you good wine--invites you to listen to Doctor Watson as he tells us about another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, Holmes. You know, I have an adventure to tell you about too... only it's a different kind of adventure--an adventure in good eating. And to experience it, all you do is serve a Petri Wine with your dinner--either a Petri California Burgundy or a Petri California Sauterne, I'm telling you, you have no idea how much a glass of that good Petri Wine can do for even the simplest war time meal. Take that Petri Burgundy for instance. Try it with a good home made pot roast or Swiss steak. A slice of that tender beef and a glass of that good Petri Burgundy make a flavour combination that spells delicious in any man's language. That hearty, full-bodied burgundy is a red wine really worth trying. And every bit as full flavoured is that swell Petri Sauterne. Petri Sauterne is a delicate white wine that can help make a simple seafood dinner a feast. And wait'll you try a glass of that Petri Sauterne with Southern fried chicken--Oh boy! Yes sir, with food, nothing can take the place of that good Petri Wine.

MUSIC: "SCOTCH POEM" by Edward MacDowell

CAMPBELL: Well, that's enough from me... how about you, Doctor Watson? I hope you have something very special for us in the way of stories tonight.

WATSON: (OFF A LITTLE) Good evening, Mr. Campbell. Don't stand there in the doorway as though you weren't sure of your welcome. Close the door and come and sit down and make yourself comfortable. You know I always look forward to these Monday evenings.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CLOSING

CAMPBELL: So do I, Doctor.

WATSON: (CHUCKLING) Yes, I think I can promise to make your hair stand on end with tonight's story. I call it "The Weird Case of the Giant Rat of Sumatra".

CAMPBELL: Sumatra--that's an island in the Far East, isn't it? Somewhere near Java?

WATSON: That's right, but the setting of my story tonight is India--India the exotic and mysterious. Holmes and I were in Calcutta waiting for a ship to take us back to England. The great man had just solved the strange mystery of "The Sacred White Elephant of Parbutipur".

CAMPBELL: "The Sacred White Elephant of Parbutipur"? That sounds intriguing. What happened there?

WATSON: (TESTILY) Really, Mr. Campbell. I can only tell you one story at a time. That adventure will have to wait for another of your visits.

CAMPBELL: I'm sorry, Doctor. Go on with your story of "The Giant Rat of Sumatra". You and Sherlock Holmes were in Calcutta waiting for a boat back to England, and that's where things started happening, I suppose?

WATSON: They did indeed, Mr. Campbell, though the whole adventure started casually enough. Holmes and I were staying at the Great Eastern Hotel, an imposing and colourful edifice overlooking Chowringee--the fashionable section of Calcutta. I'd been in India, you know, for quite a few years when I was in the Army and I rather flattered myself I could teach Holmes a thing or two about the country and its customs. But, somewhat to my chagrin, I soon discovered that Holmes was just as much as home in the country as I was. Perhaps even a little more so. On the night my story begins, Holmes and I had just finished an excellent dish of curried shrimps. We were sitting at our table and I was inhaling the bouquet of a pony of Napoleon Brandy *. A native orchestra was playing soft Oriental music and I was feeling completely relaxed and at peace as we sat there. Suddenly Holmes spoke.

MUSIC: * SNEAK IN ON CUE. UP STRONG ON WATSON'S LAST LINE, THEN DOWN AND UNDER

HOLMES: (LAUGHING) Watson, d'you know my most treasured memory of our recent encounter with the white elephant of Parbutipur?

WATSON: I imagine it was when the Maharajah gave you that check for ten-thousand pounds.

HOLMES: On the contrary, Watson. It was the night you came into the palace in a great state of excitement after you'd shot at a tiger cub. You told us how a shotgun had come on to your veranda and that you had fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it.

WATSON: (LAUGHING) Yes, I'm inclined to get a little incoherent when I get excited! Holmes--you remember in The Sign of Four how I got so flustered with Mr. Sholto that I cautioned him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil and then recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative!

HOLMES: Strychnine can be a very efficient sedative. Well, let's get the bill. I'd like to take a walk through the native markets before we retire. See if you can attract the attention of our waiter.

WATSON: (CALLING) Waiter--Hey, Waiter!

WAITER: (THIS IS HINDUSTANI, BUT IS SPELLED PHONETICALLY) (FADING IN) Bought atcha, hasoor.

WATSON: We want the bill--(LABORIOUSLY) The--bill. BILL!

WAITER: (PUZZLED) Kia munta, hasoor?

WATSON: (GETTING ANGRY) The bill. Goodness gracious, they can't even speak English.

HOLMES: (DRYLY) Why should they? (TO WAITER) Sahib-ke hissab dough.

WAITER: (DELIGHTEDLY) Hissab! (FADING) Bought atcha, hasoor.

HOLMES: Watson, you're a perfect example of the insular Englishman. I'm surprised at you. I should have thought you've lived in India long enough to have a smattering of the language.

WATSON: (GRUMPILY) I do know the language--but up in the Northwest we spoke a different lingo. And where did you learn to speak Hindustani I'd like to know?

HOLMES: Three months in Parbutipur has given me a working knowledge, at least.

WATSON: Well, I must say...

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTING) Look, Watson. Here comes the manager in a great state of excitement and he's making a bee-line for our table.

MANAGER: (FADING IN, EXCITEDLY. HE SPEAKS WITH CULTURED ACCENT) Excuse me, Mr. Holmes, but I understand your friend is a doctor?

WATSON: Yes, I am a doctor. What's the matter?

MANAGER: Could you please come to Room 106 at once? One of our servants has been bitten by a rat--a giant rat--and he's lying up there having convulsions.

HOLMES: Convulsions from a rat bite? Of course my friend will come up. Come on, Watson! Never mind your brandy!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND EFFECT: GROANING AND HEAVY BREATHING, OFF

MANAGER: Is he going to live, Doctor?

WATSON: Yes, he's going to live, but the poor fellow'll be very sick for a few days. Better take him to his quarters. I'll come and see him later.

MANAGER: Very well, Doctor. (FADING) Addmee ko layjow...

SOUND EFFECT: SCUFFLE OF FEET... GROANS OF BODY BEING LIFTED IN BACKGROUND

HOLMES: (CALLING) Before you go, where is this... er, giant rat now? And where is its owner?

MANAGER: (FADING BACK) The rat is in the bathroom, there. We tried to get it back in its cage, but we were afraid to handle it. Mr. Jackson is its owner, but he hasn't come back yet. I'm afraid he... Oh, here he is now.

JACKSON: (FADING IN EXCITEDLY. HE IS AMERICAN, ABOUT FORTY-FIVE) What the devil's going on in my room? Who are all these people and why's that man being carried out?

MANAGER: I am afraid, Mr. Jackson, that your rat escaped and bit him.

JACKSON: (FURIOUS) Escaped? What d'you mean it escaped? It must be found. Why the blazes don't you train your servants to mind their own business?

HOLMES: May I suggest you calm yourself, Mr. Jackson. Your rat--so I have just been told--is trapped in the bathroom there.

WATSON: Mr. Manager, I suggest you don't stand there in the doorway. See that poor fellow gets to his bed immediately. He's very sick.

MANAGER: (OFF) Very well, sir. Addmee ko layjow.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CLOSES OFF

JACKSON: And who are you, may I ask?

HOLMES: My name is Holmes. Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend Doctor Watson.

JACKSON: Sherlock Holmes! I've heard of you. Aren't you the English detective?

HOLMES: I am flattered that my fame has spread so far afield. But don't look worried, Mr. Jackson, I'm not in your room in any professional capacity. My friend Doctor Watson was called in to attend the bitten man. I am here because I was very curious to see how a rat bite could produce convulsions.

JACKSON: (RELAXING) Of course. I'm sorry, gentlemen, that I was so abrupt with you. The servant is going to live, isn't he, Doctor?

WATSON: Yes, but it was touch and go there for a while.

JACKSON: Thank heavens he's all right. And now if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll place my rat back in his cage. He's a little hard to handle so I suggest you don't come with me into the bathroom.

WATSON: Good Lord no. Wouldn't dream of it.

JACKSON: But please don't go. (FADING) I'd like to have a chat with you.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE QUICKLY (OFF)

HOLMES: (LOW) Watson, that bitten man had all the symptoms of poisoning, didn't he?

WATSON: (LOW) Yes, he did. I can't understand it.

HOLMES: No. Rat bites might cause an infection, but never the symptoms that poor fellow exhibited. Hmm. Very curious. Why does our friend in there keep a rat in his hotel room?

WATSON: Heaven alone knows. Disgusting things, rats. Horrible to look at and they carry germs. I can remember once when I was...

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPEN (OFF)

JACKSON: (FADING IN) Well, gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to the Giant Rat of Sumatra. Isn't he a splendid specimen?

WATSON: (NERVOUSLY) Are you sure that cage is properly fastened?

JACKSON: Don't worry, Doctor. He can't get out. What'd you think of him, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: I can't say I'm exactly a rat fancier, Mr. Jackson. But he certainly is a giant. The thing that puzzles me is that his bite has produced the symptoms of acute poisoning in that unfortunate man that was just carried out. How do you account for that?

JACKSON: If you gentlemen have a few moments, I'd like to tell you the story of that rat. I think it will help you to understand what's just happened.

HOLMES: I should be very interested to hear the story, Mr. Jackson.

WATSON: Yes... yes indeed.

JACKSON: Do either of you gentlemen care for a "chota peg"?

WATSON: Thank you. I think a scotch-and-soda would be very acceptable.

JACKSON: (OFF A LITTLE) How about you, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Thank you, no. Alcohol is one of the few vices I don't indulge in.

SOUND EFFECT: CLICKING OF GLASS AND BOTTLE

JACKSON: Say when, Doctor.

SOUND EFFECT: FIZZING OF SIPHON

WATSON: Whoa! That's splendid.

JACKSON: Ice?

WATSON: (OUTRAGED) Ice? Good heavens, no! Filthy habit.

JACKSON: Here you are.

WATSON: Thank you.

JACKSON: Well, to begin. I am a zoologist. For years now I've been roaming the world in search of rare and valuable animals to add to my collection (WITH A LAUGH). I have a miniature zoo at my farm in Connecticut in the States and, without wishing to brag, I may say my collection is quite unique. A year or so ago, I heard of an obscure tribe of Pygmies in the jungles of Sumatra who worshipped rats--rats that were reputed to be gigantic. Naturally I was determined to try and capture one for my collection and so, last September, I sailed to Sumatra. To cut a very long story short, I lived with the tribe for some months and learned many strange things--one of them being the reason for the rat's giant size. It's rather a horrible one, Mr. Holmes. They feed the animals human blood.

WATSON: Good heavens! What a shocking thing.

HOLMES: Human sacrifices for a rodent, eh? Go on, Mr. Jackson.

JACKSON: I managed to gain the confidence of one of the tribesman and, with the aid of a considerable sum of money, bribed him to steal the rat you see there. I had no compunction in doing this, for their worship of the animals is barbaric and disgusting.

WATSON: Downright disgusting.

HOLMES: Quiet, Watson.

JACKSON: My interest was purely that of the collector. And so I slipped away from the village with my prize in a cage and caught the next boat for Calcutta. I wanted to talk to the curator of the Calcutta Zoo about buying a specimen of their Himalayan tree bear whilst I was there. But my erstwhile friends in Sumatra have not been idle. I've been followed. Two attempts have been made to take the rat back. One attempt has been made on my life already. I think what happened just now was a third attempt to steal the rat.

HOLMES: Very possibly, Mr. Jackson, but I still don't understand the symptoms of poisoning.

JACKSON: I think that what undoubtedly happened was that the man just carried out was attempting to drug or poison the rat so that he could handle it. Even a dead Sumatra rat is an object of veneration amongst the tribe. Probably he opened the cage and tried to feed the poison to the rat. Possibly the rat got some on his fangs and then bit him.

HOLMES: (LAUGHING) You should have been a detective, Mr. Jackson. That's an ingenious deduction... though I can't say I find it an entirely convincing one.

JACKSON: (SUDDENLY) Mr. Holmes, you're a famous detective. Would you undertake to guard me and the rat until I'm safely on the boat for America? I'd pay you a handsome fee.

WATSON: Why not, Holmes? It's a most interesting case.

HOLMES: (LAZILY) I'm afraid not, Mr. Jackson. I'm on a holiday now and I want to relax.

WATSON: Well, 'pon my soul. I've never heard you turn down a case like this before.

HOLMES: However, we shall be here for a couple of days yet. And Doctor Watson and myself are neighbors of yours. We are in Suite 109... just down the corridor from you, so please feel free to call on us if you have any more trouble. And now, Watson, let's take that stroll. I want to observe the night life of Calcutta.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND EFFECT: INDIAN FLUTE PLAYING SNAKE-CHARMING THEME. BAZAAR AD-LIBS IN BACKGROUND

HOLMES: (KEENLY) Watson, observe the trance-like condition of that snake. See... the glazed eyes... the immobile body... Fascinating. Quite fascinating. The powers of music are often more potent in the animal kingdom than in the human.

WATSON: (IMPATIENTLY) Yes... yes... it's very interesting. You know, Holmes, I still don't understand why you turned down that Jackson case. A scared rat... a man poisoned... it's just the kind of case that's always fascinated you.

SOUND EFFECT: INDIAN FLUTE CEASES

HOLMES: Give that fellow a rupee. He's given us a fine performance.

WATSON: (MUTTERING) A rupee. That's rather a lot, isn't it? Here you are.

SOUND EFFECT: COIN BEING TOSSED ON STONE

COOLIE: (OFF) Salaam, Sahib. Burra Salaam.

HOLMES: Let's explore the Bazaar a little further.

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS ON STONE. INDIAN FLUTE STARTS IN BACKGROUND AGAIN AND FADES AWAY

HOLMES: So you're worried, my dear fellow because I didn't accept Mr. Jackson's commission?

WATSON: I'm not worried, Holmes. I'm just surprised.

HOLMES: Well, don't be, old fellow. I'm very much interested in the case. But sometimes one has a greater... ah, latitude of behaviour in a case when one is observing it from the outside. If Mr. Jackson thinks he needs protection, he should apply to the official police.

WATSON: But if you are interested in the case, why are we wandering through this bazaar? Why aren't we back at the hotel keeping an eye on Jackson and his wretched rat?

HOLMES: We are going back to the hotel, Watson. But first of all I have a visit to make. This apparently aimless stroll is taking us to the Calcutta Zoo. I want to have a little chat with the curator there. You know Watson, I have a feeling that before this night is out, the giant rat of Sumatra will bite again!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND EFFECT: VIOLIN IN BACKGROUND IMPROVISING THE THEME WE HEARD FROM THE SNAKE CHARMER IN PRECEEDING SCENE

WATSON: It's nearly one o'clock in the morning. D'you think you ought to keep scraping away at that violin? There are people trying to sleep, y'know.

HOLMES: Nonsense.

SOUND EFFECT: VIOLIN BREAKS OFF MELODY

HOLMES: Confound it! What can't I capture that snake-charming melody?

SOUND EFFECT: VIOLIN PLAYS AGAIN

WATSON: Holmes, did you learn anything from the curator tonight? I listened to your discussion, but I'll be hanged if I could understand a word either of you were talking about.

HOLMES: You're a medical man. You should at least have found it as understandable as I did.

WATSON: I'm a simple General Practitioner. When you stray off into the subtleties of Oriental poisons and the anatomy of rodents, I'm out of my field and I don't mind confessing it.

SOUND EFFECT: VIOLIN COMPLETES THEME, THEN FINISHES WITH A LITTLE FLOURISH

HOLMES: (EXCITEDLY) That's it! At last I've got it.

SOUND EFFECT: VIOLIN BEING PLACED ON TABLE

HOLMES: Now I can go to bed.

WATSON: Well, thank heavens for that. (YAWNING) I must say I'm ready to turn in myself. You still haven't answered my question, Holmes.

HOLMES: Hmm... question? What question?

WATSON: I asked whether you learnt anything from your discussion over at the zoo tonight?

HOLMES: Oh yes. I learnt a great deal. A very great deal. In fact I may say that--

SOUND EFFECT: PIERCING MALE SCREAM (OFF)

WATSON: Good Heavens! D'you hear that? That came from Jackson's room!

HOLMES: Quick, Watson!

SOUND EFFECT: RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. DOOR OPEN. FOOTSTEPS ON SLIGHT ECHO

HOLMES: (BREATHLESSLY) Have you got your revolver with you?

WATSON: (PANTING) No... shall I go back for it?

HOLMES: Never mind, I have mine. Here we are--

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR WRENCHED OPEN, ANOTHER PIERCING SCREAM. FOOTSTEPS CEASE. SCRABBLING AND YELPING OF RAT

JACKSON: (HYSTERICALLY) Back! Get back there!

HOLMES: Watson! See what you can do for that poor fellow there. I'll take care of the rat.

JACKSON: (VIOLENTLY) No, Mr. Holmes! Put that revolver away! I'll get the rat back in the cage, but don't shoot it! It's too valuable.

HOLMES: (GRIMLY) You'd better hurry then. Here... throw this bedspread over it!

SOUND EFFECT: AGONISED DEATH RATTLE OF DYING MAN

WATSON: Holmes... the man's done for.

SOUND EFFECT: YELPING OF RAT SUDDENLY STIFLED. THE CLANG OF A CAGE DOOR CLOSING

JACKSON: There! The rat's back in the cage!

HOLMES: Just in time, Mr. Jackson. I was about to bring your pet's career to an abrupt end.

SOUND EFFECT: LAST SPASMS OF DYING MAN

WATSON: The man's dead, Holmes. Poor devil... look at that expression on his face... the contorted features... the staring eyeballs... the arched back.

HOLMES: Exactly. All the symptoms of strychnine poisoning! Mr. Jackson, I'm afraid your chances of taking the rat back to America are very slight. I think you'll find the police will insist on killing him and performing an autopsy.

MUSIC: CURTAIN

CAMPBELL: Well... so Holmes is now turning the case over to the Indian police. We'll find his motive for doing so in just a few seconds when our story continues. Meanwhile, I'd like to remind you that the best time to begin a good dinner is before the beginning. While you're waiting for dinner to be ready, try a glass of Petri California Sherry. Petri Sherry is one of the most famous of all sherry wines... and rightly so. Because Petri Sherry has a perfect color, a wonderful aroma--"bouquet" the experts call it--and as for its flavour--well, Petri Sherry has a flavour that comes right from the heart of luscious California grapes. And say--if like most men--you like your sherry dry... well, you certainly ought to try a Petri pale dry sherry. That is something! And remember--you can serve Petri sherry proudly... because the name "Petri" is the proudest name in the history of American wines.

MUSIC: "SCOTCH POEM"

CAMPBELL: And now back to tonight's new adventure of Sherlock Holmes. Doctor Watson and his famous friend are in Calcutta awaiting a boat to take them back to England. Whilst staying at the Great Eastern Hotel, they have become involved in the strange case of the Giant Rat of Sumatra--a rat whose bite is sudden death. As we rejoin our story, Holmes and Watson are seated in the bedroom of Mr. Jackson, the owner of the rat (FADE) awaiting the arrival of the police...

WATSON: Two-thirty in the morning and still the police haven't arrived.

HOLMES: Patience, Watson. They'll be here.

JACKSON: This is terrible. Mr. Holmes, you really think they'll kill my rat?

HOLMES: It's hard for me to predict what the police will do, but personally I can see no alternative. The rat has bitten and killed one man, and severely poisoned another. The cause of death looks like strychnine poisoning. It seems obvious that if the rat bite did kill the man, the first thing to do is to dissect the rat and discover how it was able to deliver this lethal bite.

WATSON: What d'you mean "if" the rat bite killed him? We know it did.

HOLMES: We know it bit him.

JACKSON: What is your theory, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: I never theorize. By the way, Mr. Jackson--being a zoologist you are naturally familiar with the Tamana... the Tamana... the Darjeeling snow bird?

JACKSON: Oh, yes... Yes, of course.

HOLMES: There's an excellent specimen that's just arrived at the zoo. We saw it earlier on today.

WATSON: Darjeeling snow bird? I don't remember any--

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTING) You never remember anything, my dear fellow. Mr. Jackson: The man who was killed here in this room tonight. Have you ever seen him before?

JACKSON: Never.

HOLMES: Are you still of the opinion that he was employed by the tribe in Sumatra to recapture the sacred animal?

JACKSON: I can't think of any other motive.

SOUND EFFECT: KNOCK ON DOOR

HOLMES: Ah... that must be the police now.

JACKSON: (CALLING) Come in.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPEN

SINGH: (OFF. CULTURED, SLIGHT ACCENT) Mr. Jackson?

JACKSON: Yes... that's right.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CLOSE

SINGH: (FADING IN) I am Inspector Singh of the Bengal Police.

JACKSON: Sit down, Inspector. These two gentlemen are Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.

SINGH: Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I am very honored to meet you, Mr. Holmes. We in the Indian Police service are very familiar with your brilliant work in Europe.

HOLMES: Thank you.

SINGH: Also your recent handling of the case of the white elephant for the Maharajah of Parbutipur. I am flattered to be associated with you in this case.

HOLMES: I'm merely a spectator, Inspector. Pray proceed as though I were not present.

SINGH: Thank you. Mr. Jackson, we have just performed an autopsy on the man bitten in this room tonight. He died of strychnine poisoning. Naturally, we shall have to kill the rat and perform an autopsy on it too.

JACKSON: This is dreadful! The rat is worth thousands of dollars to me.

SINGH: (STERNLY) Undoubtedly the dead man's life was worth even more to him. No, Mr. Jackson, your rat will have to die. I shall return within the hour with the necessary authority to take the rat for dissection. Before I leave, I'd like the exact facts as to the tragedy tonight.

HOLMES: (YAWNING) I think if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'll turn in. Are you coming Watson? It's a quarter-to-three in the morning.

WATSON: (SURPRISED) Yes, I suppose so, though I must say I'm surprised at your leaving...

HOLMES: There is nothing further we can do. Inspector Singh is in efficient command. Good night, Inspector. Good night, Mr. Jackson.

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS

WATSON, SINGH, AND JACKSON AD LIB "GOOD NIGHTS"

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CLOSE. FOOTSTEPS ON SLIGHT ECHO

WATSON: (CUE) Holmes, I just don't understand your handling of this case. Walking out just as the police walk in.

HOLMES: Don't you, Watson? There was nothing more to be learned in there--merely a recapitulation of what we already know. Come into the room and I'll tell you my plans.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE. FOOTSTEPS STOP

WATSON: (MUTTERING) I'll never get any sleep tonight.

HOLMES: Perhaps not. But think of the satisfied sleep you can have on the boat--when the case of the Giant Rat is solved.

WATSON: Good Lord, Holmes. You think you've solved it?

HOLMES: Almost, my dear fellow. Almost. There is just one more thing to be done... and it's a job for you.

WATSON: Of course, Holmes. What is it?

HOLMES: I must examine that rat before it is taken away. You must get Jackson out as soon as Singh leaves. I don't care what excuse you make, but get him out of the hotel for half-an-hour.

WATSON: Of course I'll do it. But I say, Holmes... be careful when you get near that rat.

HOLMES: Don't worry, old fellow. I've learnt quite a bit about the behaviour of rats from our visit to the zoo today. Also, you will observe that pair of leather gloves lying on the table there. No, I'm taking no chances. Within an hour from now, I think I can promise you the solution to the case!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

WATSON: Well, Holmes, I got our friend Jackson to come out and have a drink with me. He's gone back to his room now. Did I give you enough time?

HOLMES: You've done splendidly Watson. Splendidly. I have completed my examination of the rat and laid all my plans, and there's no time to waste. Better bring your revolver.

WATSON: Revolver? What do I--?

HOLMES: Don't argue. Do as I say. This is a matter of life and death.

WATSON: Oh, all right. Here it is on the table.

HOLMES: Now follow me...

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS... DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE. FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE

HOLMES: Quickly, Watson... in here...

WATSON: But this isn't Jackson's room... this is 104.

HOLMES: This is the room next to his. It's empty and I have obtained the key. Come in.

SOUND EFFECT: KEY TURNING IN LOCK. DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE

WATSON: What on earth are you up to, Holmes?

HOLMES: You'll soon see. We open those French windows...

SOUND EFFECT: WINDOW BEING OPENED

HOLMES: So... and what do we find?

WATSON: By Jove! A balcony!

HOLMES: Exactly. A balcony that extends under Mr. Jackson's window. Now slip off your shoes, Watson, and keep your voice down. Come on. We'll have a grandstand seat. And keep your revolver handy... Here we go...

SOUND EFFECT: FAINT SHUFFLE OF FEET. SOUNDS OF EXERTION

HOLMES: (AFTER A PAUSE, WHISPERING) Here we are, Watson. This gives us a view of the whole room.

WATSON: (WHISPERING) Yes. There's Jackson sitting facing the door... and the rat's beside him on the table. I hope that cage is securely fastened.

HOLMES: Shh... Here comes Inspector Singh now. We've timed this perfectly... keep your eyes peeled...

WATSON: (AFTER A MOMENT) Singh's got the warrant. They seem to be arguing about it... Singh's moving towards the cage... (EXCITEDLY) Look! Jackson's opening the cage Great heavens! He's thrown it on the floor! The rat's loose!

HOLMES: (GRIMLY) Exactly! And here comes Jackson now! Grab him, Watson! He's trying to get out this way. I'll get the rat!

SOUND EFFECT: WINDOW OPENED VIOLENTLY. SOUND OF RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. HOARSE SHOUTING. YELPING OF RAT

WATSON: (FADING A LITTLE) No you don't, Jackson!

SOUND EFFECT: STRUGGLE

JACKSON: (OFF A LITTLE) Let me go!

HOLMES: Look out, Singh! Move away from there!

SOUND EFFECT: REVOLVER SHOT. YELP OF RAT (OFF)

HOLMES: (FADE IN) And that, I think, is the end of the rat. (CALLING) Watson, bring Mr. Jackson back in here.

WATSON: (OFF) Come along.

JACKSON: (FADING IN) This is all a ridiculous mistake!

HOLMES: Inspector Singh, I don't know whether a pair of handcuffs is part of your regular equipment?

SINGH: Yes, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Then I suggest you slip them on our friend Mr. Jackson here. He's your murderer.

SOUND EFFECT: CLICK OF HANDCUFFS

JACKSON: I'll get you for this, Holmes! You see if I don't!

HOLMES: Hardly. The gallows will get you first.

SINGH: But, Mr. Holmes, I don't understand how you solved this case.

WATSON: Nor do I. Will you stop keeping us in the dark any longer, Holmes, and tell us how the devil you know that Jackson is the murderer?

HOLMES: With pleasure. Let me first slip on these leather gloves. Even in death our rat can still be extremely lethal. Now, gentlemen, to be technical, here is the weapon that was used to commit the murder. This rat. First of all let me point out the fang here. It's really an extremely clever piece of dental work. The center of the tooth has been drilled hollow and in the cavity has been inserted a tiny hypodermic needle--a needle containing strychnine. On biting anything--a natural impulse in a rat--the needle would puncture the skin, injecting strychnine, and so producing immediate death. Ingenious isn't it?

WATSON: But why should he have done that? I say, Jackson, did you go to all that trouble just to protect the rat from the vengeful Sumatra tribe who were trying to recapture him?

SINGH: Mr. Jackson, I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence against you.

JACKSON: I'll tell you nothing. Ask Mr. Sherlock Holmes. He seems to know everything.

HOLMES: Certainly I'll tell you. Your guess isn't a bad one, Watson. The rat was equipped with a device for protecting itself from capture--but not from a Pygmy Tribe in Sumatra who worship rats. That was a colourful story invented by Mr. Jackson. There are no Pygmies in Sumatra, but there are Pygmies in the Andaman Islands some three-hundred miles away. If you read your papers thoroughly, you will recall that some five weeks ago, the famous Hapang diamond was stolen from the head of the idol worshipped by the Andaman Islanders.

WATSON: Good heavens! But where is the diamond now?

HOLMES: If you will observe the underside of the belly of this rat, you will notice this large bulge. When you perform your autopsy, Mr. Singh, you will find the Hapang diamond cleverly inserted between the skin and the flesh of the dead rat. A very ingenious safe for your treasure, Mr. Jackson--a safe that defends itself with a bite of death. But I'm afraid you reckoned without meeting Sherlock Holmes.

WATSON: Look out! He's going for the window!

JACKSON: (FADING HYSTERICALLY) You'll never get me! Never!

SOUND EFFECT: CRASH OF GLASS, FOLLOWED BY FADING SCREAM

WATSON: Great heavens! He's gone. Through the window and over the balcony. Poor devil!

HOLMES: (STERNLY) I should save your sympathy, Watson. A man who kills with a rat must expect to die like one!

MUSIC: UP TO STRONG FINISH

CAMPBELL: Well, Doctor Watson, you promised to make my hair stand on end and you've certainly succeeded! That's quite a story. But I still don't understand when Holmes first became suspicious of Mr. Jackson.

WATSON: (CHUCKLING) Nor did I. But coming home on the boat, the great man told me a lot of illuminating facts. For instance, d'you remember his asking Jackson if he was familiar with the Tamana--the Darjeeling snow bird?

CAMPBELL: Yes, I do. And Mr. Jackson said that he was familiar with it.

WATSON: Exactly. (LAUGHING) There is no such bird! Holmes invented it! So of course he knew at once that the man was no zoologist.

CAMPBELL: (LAUGHING) Well Doctor, to tell the truth, I didn't know that Holmes had invented the Darjeeling Snow Bird, so I guess that proves I'm no zoologist either.

WATSON: Well, you don't profess to be--you're a wine expert.

CAMPBELL: Now wait a minute, Doctor--don't get me wrong. I never said I was a wine expert. I judge wine just like anybody else does. I taste it... and if the wine tastes good--well, then I say it's a good wine.

WATSON: That sounds like good common sense.

CAMPBELL: And I say that Petri Wine is good because the Petri family knows how to make wine that's really delicious. That's because the Petri family has been making wine for generations. And ever since they started their business, back in the last century, they've kept it in the family. Therefore they've been able to hand down from father to son, from father to son, all they've ever learned about the art of wine-making--that fine art of turning plump, sun-ripened grapes into clear, fragrant, delicious wine. And because the making of Petri wine is a family affair--naturally the family takes a great deal of pride in every bottle of wine that bears their name. That's why--even today--when the demand for Petri wine is so great, Petri Wine is still made in the same, old-fashioned, unhurried way. So if you want a wine to serve with your meals, or a wine to make a refreshing wine and soda--no matter what type of wine you wish--you can't go wrong with a Petri Wine, because Petri took time to bring you good wine. And now...

WATSON: I know. You want me to give you a hint about next week's story. Next week, Mr. Campbell, I have a strange story for you. It takes place on a lonely island off the Cornish coast--an island containing a lighthouse--a strange bird, and a... an extremely frightened politician...

OPENING COMMERCIAL

FORMAN: The Petri family -- the family that took time to bring you good wine -- invites you to listen to Doctor Watson tell us about another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend -- that master detective -- Sherlock Holmes. I'm all set for a good story tonight -- because I had a swell dinner this evening. My family had chicken -- fried chicken -- and with that chicken, naturally, we had Petri California Sauterne. You know, what with rationing tightening up and chicken being ration free, we're having chicken more often than I suppose we ought to. But when you can have chicken and Petri Sauterne -- boy, you're really eating! That Petri Sauterne is a wine that can make any meal taste better. Petri Sauterne has a beautiful golden color that brings sparkle and cheer to your table . . . it makes even a simple wartime meal look fancy. And when it comes to flavor -- well, that Petri Sauterne has a flavor right from the heart of luscious, hand-picked, California grapes, a flavor that's subtle . . . delicate and intriguing. Try Petri Sauterne the next time you have chicken. Share Petri Sauterne with your friends -- Yes, and serve it proudly, because the name "Petri" is the proudest name in the history of American Wines!

MUSIC: SCOTCH POEM

FORMAN: And now for our weekly visit with the good Doctor Watson. Evening, Doctor.

WATSON: Good evening, Mr. Forman. Quite foggy out tonight, isn't it, my boy?

FORMAN: It certainly is, Doctor. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get here.

WATSON: You should have seen the fogs we used to get in London in the old days.

FORMAN: Pea-soupers, I believe you used to call them, didn't you? Does tonight's story take place in one by any chance, Doctor?

WATSON: No, as a matter of fact, it doesn't. Although a slight drizzle of rain, which out here you call "precipitation", was the start of all the trouble. Draw up your chair and make yourself comfortable. Smoke?

FORMAN: Thanks. I rather think I will. I - I've brought my own cigarettes, you see.

WATSON: Very thoughtful of you, my boy. On looking back over the years, I'm inclined to think it was one of the oddest problems Sherlock Holmes ever solved. It began when a man went back into his house to get his umbrella -- and proceeded to vanish off the face of the earth!

FORMAN: That sounds exciting!

WATSON: It started conventionally enough. Holmes and I had been to the St. James Hall to hear a noted Italian violinist, and after the concert, we returned to Baker Street to find Inspector Lestrade waiting for us. As we came up the stairs and opened the door -- there he was (FADING) pacing up and down our room . . . .

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS. DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE.

LESTRADE: (FADING IN) . . . Mr. Holmes, I'm certainly glad to see you! Evenin', Doctor Watson.

WATSON: Hello, Lestrade.

HOLMES: Lestrade, my dear fellow, you seem very agitated. I shall presume, therefore, that this is not entirely a social call.

LESTRADE: It isn't, Mr. Holmes. I'm onto one of the most puzzling cases I've ever had -- and that's a fact.

HOLMES: And you want my help in the matter?

LESTRADE: I certainly do, sir.

HOLMES: Splendid. Sit down and tell me all about it.

LESTRADE: Well, Mr. Holmes, it sounds like one of those tricks Maskelyne and Devant do on the music halls. Yesterday afternoon, a man by the name of William Rush left his house in Onslow Square, and went out to a carriage with his partner -- a man by the name of Nathan Black. As he reached the carriage, it started to rain, so he said he'd go back to the house for his umbrella. Black saw him open the front door and go in -- but he didn't come out again. After a little while, Mr. Black got worried and went after him, but not only was there no sign of the man, but his wife and brother who were inside the house swore he never did come back.

WATSON: What an amazing story!

HOLMES: You searched the house thoroughly, of course.

LESTRADE: I've searched, and examined, and questioned until I'm blue in the face, Mr. Holmes, an' I can't find no trace of him.

HOLMES: Hmm. Was anyone able to verify Mr. Black's story?

LESTRADE: Yes, Mr. Holmes -- Mr. Black's coachman. He swore on oath that he saw Rush go back into the house.

HOLMES: And the couple inside the house swore he didn't come back, eh, Lestrade?

LESTRADE: That's right, sir.

WATSON: But people just don't vanish in thin air, y' know.

HOLMES: A very intriguing problem, Lestrade. The couple outside swear the man went back -- the couple inside swear that he didn't. If neither couple is lying, one might think that somewhere within the thickness of a front door a man has vanished!

WATSON: That's what it looks like, Holmes. What are you going to do about it?

HOLMES: Do, old chap? I'm going to do the obvious thing. I'm going to pay a visit to Onslow Square.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

LESTRADE: Well, I hope you're satisfied, Mr. Holmes. You must have searched every inch of the house.

HOLMES: I am, thank you. And now, Lestrade, I'd like to talk to Mrs. Rush and her brother-in-law.

LESTRADE: They're waiting for you in the library. I'll take you in.

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS ON WOOD. FOOTSTEPS STOP. KNOCK ON DOOR

ISABEL: (OFF) Come in.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPEN. FOOTSTEPS

LESTRADE: Mrs. Rush . . . this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. They're working with me on the case.

ISABEL: Good evening, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Watson.

WATSON: How d'you do, Mrs. Rush. 

HOLMES: Good evening, madam.

LESTRADE: And this is her husband's brother, Captain Stanley Rush.

HOLMES: How are you, sir?

WATSON: How do you do, Captain Rush.

STANLEY: (ABOUT FORTY -- GRUFF, UNPLEASANT) How d'you do.

LESTRADE: And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to the Yard and make a report. (FADING) Good evening. See you later, Mr. Holmes.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CLOSE

ISABEL: Sit down, won't you? And tell me what I can do to help you.

HOLMES: (AFTER A MOMENT) Thank you, Mrs. Rush. I just want to ask you a few questions.

ISABEL: Ask me anything you want to, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: First, are you convinced -- beyond any shadow of a doubt -- that your husband did not re-enter the front door after he left here yesterday afternoon?

ISABEL: I'm . . . positive.

HOLMES: Then please tell me exactly what happened, Mrs. Rush.

ISABEL: After my husband and Nathan Black had gone, Stanley and I came back here into this room. I'd left this door open as I intended going out myself soon, and was about to go upstairs to change my dress. After a few moments, I started to leave the room, and as I passed the window I noticed that the carriage was still waiting (FADING) in the street outside . . . .

ISABEL: Stanley? Whatever's holding them up out there? The carriage hasn't moved.

STANLEY: (FADING IN) I don't know. Let's find out. I'll yell at 'em from the window.

SOUND: WINDOW BEING OPENED

STANLEY: Hello -- it's started to rain. (RAISING HIS VOICE) What's keeping you, Nathan?

BLACK: (OFF CALLING -- ABOUT FIFTY) We're waiting for Bill.

STANLEY: But he came out with you.

BLACK: He went back -- for his umbrella.

STANLEY: He couldn't have done. We'd have seen him.

BLACK: Yes he did, Stanley, I saw him go in the front door.

STANLEY: (CALLING) Better come back here, Nathan. (TO ISABEL) I don't know what he's talking about. He says that Bill came back for his umbrella.

ISABEL: This doesn't make sense. Let's go and find out what Nathan's talking about.

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS. AFTER A MOMENT, DOOR OPENS

BLACK: (FADING IN -- LAUGHING) Well, d'you believe me? Where is he?

STANLEY: I tell you Bill didn't come back here.

BLACK: And I tell you I saw him unlock the front door!

STANLEY: That's ridiculous! Isabel and I were just inside the library here. We'd have seen him.

BLACK: Yes, you would. But the fact remains I saw him enter and close the front door behind him -- and so did the coachman!

ISABEL: (STARTING TO PANIC) Something's happened to him!

STANLEY: Now Isabel -- what could have happened between the carriage and here?

ISABEL: I don't know -- but something has!

STANLEY: This is utterly ridiculous. (FADING) A man can't just dissolve --

ISABEL: (FADE IN) We searched the house from top to bottom, Mr. Holmes, and we found no trace of William, so I got in touch with Scotland Yard.

HOLMES: Before your husband and his partner, Mr. Black, left yesterday afternoon, had you been discussing anything of a significant nature -- or was it just a social gathering?

ISABEL: No, it was a conference about the business.

STANLEY: And my brother also told us the terms of his will.

WATSON: What were those terms, may I ask, Captain Rush?

STANLEY: He left everything to Isabel, and named me as executor.

HOLMES: Was this a new will?

ISABEL: Yes, it was.

HOLMES: Signed?

STANLEY: No. Bill wanted to discuss it with us first.

HOLMES: What were the terms of the previous will?

STANLEY: Isabel was to get three-quarters of the estate, and I was to get one-quarter.

HOLMES: So that the new will -- had your brother signed it -- would have cut you, Captain Rush, out of any benefits?

STANLEY: (ANGRILY) Are you suggesting that I tried to get rid of my own brother to prevent him signing the will?

HOLMES: Captain Rush, you seem remarkably touchy. I'm only asking some obvious questions. I'm not suggesting anything.

STANLEY: I'm sorry.

HOLMES: This business conference -- was it entirely an amicable one?

ISABEL: (HESITANTLY) Well . . . .

STANLEY: Might as well tell the truth, darling.

WATSON: Yes, indeed, madam. We can't possibly help you unless you tell us everything.

ISABEL: My husband had quite a heated argument with Nathan Black. Nathan handles the financial side of the business, you see, and he got very angry when William said he was going to get a certified accountant in to go over the books and figures.

HOLMES: Did your husband accuse Mr. Black of dishonesty?

ISABEL: No, but he implied it. However, by the time they left, it had all blown over and they seemed on the best of terms.

WATSON: May I ask, madam, what is your personal opinion of Mr. Black?

ISABEL: I dislike -- and distrust him.

HOLMES: That's concise. And you, Captain Rush?

STANLEY: I've always disliked him, but I haven't distrusted him until a few weeks ago.

HOLMES: Was there something that caused you to change your opinion as to his honesty?

STANLEY: Last month, Bill and I were going through some of my father's papers, and we came across an old diary that he'd been writing in just before his death. We found some entries concerning a copper mine in South America, and also some references to buying shares in a silk house in Paris. Now Nathan was executor of my father's estate, and as we'd never heard of these interests until we read the diary. . . naturally we questioned him. After all, he'd been my father's partner for sixteen years.

HOLMES: And what did he say?

STANLEY: That he knew nothing about it. Of course we didn't believe him. And that started Bill looking into the current business affairs a little more closely.

HOLMES: When did your father die, Captain Rush?

STANLEY: Three years ago -- in a yachting accident. And that's another thing -- the only other person on the boat was Nathan. He tells a story of how he tried to save Father and nearly drowned himself in doing it. But I'd lay you hundred guineas to one he murdered him and then capsized the boat to make it look like an accident.

HOLMES: Did your brother believe that, too?

STANLEY: Yes, he did.

WATSON: And yet you've both said that when your brother an' Mr. Black left here yesterday, they were on the best of terms. Seems a little incongruous, under the circumstances.

STANLEY: (FLUSTERED) Perhaps Bill didn't feel it as strongly as I did. But he definitely distrusted him.

HOLMES: Hmm. Where d'you suppose we might find Mr. Nathan Black at this time of night?

STANLEY: That's easy to answer, Nathan is a man of habit. He always dines at the Criterion Restaurant -- when he's in London. It's only eight-thirty. I imagine you'll still find him there.

HOLMES: Thank you, Captain Rush. And many thanks to you both for your help and cooperation. Come along, Watson.

ISABEL: Mr. Holmes -- Do you think you're going to be able to find out what's happened to William?

HOLMES: I hope so, Mrs. Rush. I hope so sincerely.

MUSIC: BRIDGE (STRAUSS WALTZ THEME). ORCHESTRA CONTINUES PLAYING STRAUSS WALTZ

HOLMES: (AFTER A MOMENT) Mr. Nathan Black?

BLACK: (FADING IN) Yes, gentlemen. What can I do for you?

HOLMES: My name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend, Doctor Watson.

(AD LIB "HOW DO YOU DO'S")

HOLMES: We're investigating the disappearance of your partner, Mr. Rush.

BLACK: Sit down, Mr. Holmes, won't you? And Doctor -- ? I'm very glad to meet you.

SOUND EFFECT: CHAIRS BEING MOVED

BLACK: A dreadful business. Have there been any new developments?

HOLMES: I'm afraid not. You don't mind if I ask you a few personal questions do you, Mr. Black?

BLACK: Of course not. Fire away.

HOLMES: Mr. Black, wasn't there some little difference of opinion between you and your partner regarding a diary that was recently discovered?

BLACK: (LAUGHING) I see that Stanley Rush has been talking to you! All I can tell you, gentlemen, is that if their father had any interest in copper in South America, or silk in France, that it's the first I ever heard of it.

WATSON: Then may I ask, sir, how you account for those entries in the diary?

BLACK: I could answer that question a little better if I'd seen this supposed entry in the diary. Personally, I don't think it exists -- except in Stanley's imagination.

HOLMES: Mr. Black, despite this argument you indulged in with the missing man yesterday, I understand you left the house together on the best of terms?

BLACK: Oh yes. We've had disagreements before, but they always blew over -- as this one did. I'm much too fond of William to stay angry with him for very long.

HOLMES: You're convinced, aren't you, that your partner went back into the house for his umbrella yesterday afternoon?

BLACK: Of course I am -- because I saw it with my own eyes. If you need any corroboration, you can ask my coachman.

HOLMES: I should like to hear his version -- purely as a matter of routine.

BLACK: He's waiting for me outside now. Why not question him at once?

HOLMES: An excellent idea. And many thanks for your courtesy, Mr. Black.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND EFFECT: STREET NOISES

BLACK: (AFTER A FEW MOMENTS) Here's my carriage, Mr. Holmes . . . (CALLING) Taylor come down here a minute, will you?

TAYLOR: (FADING IN -- MIDDLE-AGED COCKNEY) Right y'are, Mr. Black.

BLACK: This gentleman would like to ask you a few questions. Go ahead, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Taylor. . .you were standing outside when Mr. Rush and your employer came out yesterday, weren't you?

TAYLOR: That's right, guv'nor.

HOLMES: Will you give your own version of what happened, please.

TAYLOR: They come out to the carriage. I hops down and opens the door for 'em. As they start to step in, it begins to drizzle wiv' rain, an' Mr. Rush says he's goin' back to get his umbrella. He climbs up the steps again, unlocks the front door wiv' 'is latchkey, and goes in an' closes the door behind 'im . . . and that's the last I sees of him. After a few minutes, Captain Rush comes to the window and asks us why we're waiting and that's when all the how-d'-you-do starts.

HOLMES: Thank you, Taylor.

BLACK: Satisfied, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Yes, but puzzled, Mr. Black. Very puzzled. In fact, I think I'd better return to Baker Street. I'm very much afraid this is at least a three-pipe problem.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

WATSON: (SLEEPILY) Holmes, it's nearly two o'clock in the morning, you're smoking your fifth pipe -- and yet you said it was only a three-pipe problem.

HOLMES: Obviously, therefore, old chap, I underestimated the problem.

WATSON: I've been puzzling about the case, and I have a couple of theories.

HOLMES: Good. Let's hear them.

WATSON: Well, I was reading a book the other day -- I think it was by Henry James -- in which a man had the ability to slip back through time and come out in another century, maybe two- or three- hundred years ago.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLING) Watson, dear fellow, you're most refreshing. You mean that you think that Mr. Rush stepped through that front door yesterday -- and into another century?

WATSON: It's rather a wild theory, I must admit, but it seems to me this whole case can only have a supernatural explanation.

HOLMES: Let us leave the supernatural explanations until we have disposed of the natural ones. Four witnesses have testified to the impossible. Therefore two of them must be at least mistaken. The question is -- which two?

WATSON: My other theory was connected with hypnotism. Supposing Rush wanted to disappear for some reason, and so he hypnotized the witnesses. Now you know as well as I do that hypnotism is a perfectly --

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTING EXCITEDLY) Idiot! Numbskull!

WATSON: (HURT) Well, that's very rude, Holmes. I'm not pretending they're very sound theories.

HOLMES: No, old chap. I'm the idiot!

WATSON: What d'you mean?

HOLMES: The umbrella -- That's the clue! William Rush returned for his umbrella. If it's still there, he might have gone back for it. If it's not, then perhaps he had it all the time. Get your hat and coat, Watson!

WATSON: You mean we're going to the house at this time of the night?

HOLMES: Certainly.

WATSON: But you can't rout people out of bed at two in the morning.

HOLMES: I don't propose to. I have skeleton keys, and anyway, I don't want to draw attention to our visit. Our enemy -- whoever he may be -- could think of the same thing at any moment. We must hope that we get there before him!

MUSIC: UP STRONG

FORMAN: We'll bring you the rest of Doctor Watson's story in just a few seconds, which gives me plenty of time to mention a wine that can make even a sandwich taste like a feast -- That wine is Petri California Burgundy. Petri Burgundy is the best friend a good meal ever had, and it's a friend indeed to simple, war-time meals. A rich deep red in color and hearty, full and delicious in flavor -- Petri Burgundy is the perfect companion for all your old standby dishes. Petri Burgundy is great with hamburger sandwiches . . . it's just about the last word when you have good old-fashioned spaghetti. And if you're planning a piping hot pot roast or your favorite beef stew -- well, you just can't forget Petri Burgundy. Believe me, with food, nothing can take the place of that good Petri Wine!

MUSIC: SCOTCH POEM

FORMAN: And now, back to tonight's new Sherlock Holmes adventure. William Rush, wealthy business man, stepping back into his house for his umbrella, has apparently vanished from the face of the earth, and Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson are investigating the strange mystery. As we rejoin our story, it is two-thirty in the morning and the famous pair are engaged in breaking into the missing (FADING) man's house.

SOUND EFFECT: SCRATCHING OF KEY IN LOCK

WATSON: (WHISPERING) I don't like this, Holmes -- breaking into people's houses in the middle of the night.

HOLMES: Hold the lantern a little higher, will you, old chap -- that's it. There we are.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING SOFTLY. STEALTHY FOOTSTEPS

HOLMES: (AFTER AN APPRECIABLE PAUSE) The umbrella stand. Now what do we find?

WATSON: Several parasols . . . obviously Mrs. Rush's.

HOLMES: One very shabby umbrella. And -- what have we here -- this looks more like it.

WATSON: By Jove, yes. A neatly rolled one with a gold band on it.

HOLMES: Yes, but unfortunately for our purposes, it has the initials "S.R." on the band. Obviously, it belongs to Captain Stanley Rush. And that completes the collection.

WATSON: Then William Rush's umbrella isn't here, and that means he had it with him all the time -- and that he didn't come back.

HOLMES: That would appear to be what happened, my dear Watson. On the other hand, someone might have assumed we would reason along those lines, and in consequence have hidden or destroyed the umbrella.

WATSON: That's true. I wonder where they might have hidden it?

HOLMES: I'd suggest the cellar as being a likely place. Also, it has the advantage of having a most convenient furnace down there. Come on . . . through the kitchen.

SOUND EFFECT: STEALTHY FOOTSTEPS. AFTER A MOMENT, DOOR OPENING

HOLMES: And now, down these stairs . . . watch your head.

WATSON: Holmes, you don't need to tell me to -- (EXCLAIMING) Ouch! Confound it! Why do they design staircases for midgets?

HOLMES: Shh, old fellow. We don't want to wake the whole house.

SOUND EFFECT: STEALTHY FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING STAIRS (NOTE: VOICES IN ENSUING SCENE ON ECHO)

HOLMES: (AFTER A FEW MOMENTS) Well, here we are.

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS ON LEVEL

WATSON: (SUDDENLY) Hello! That furnace is burning very brightly!

HOLMES: Yes. Surely no one's been stoking it at this hour of the morning.

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS STOP 

HOLMES: Let's see what's burning.

SOUND EFFECT: FURNACE DOOR BEING OPENED

WATSON: (EXCITEDLY) By George, Holmes! It's a burning umbrella!

HOLMES: Give me that poker . . . That's it . . . Now let's see if I can get it out again ... .

SOUND EFFECT: RATTLING OF POKER AGAINST FURNACE

WATSON: Good work, Holmes! You've got it!

SOUND EFFECT: STAMPING OF FEET

HOLMES: (GRUNTING) First of all, we'll put out the flames.

SOUND EFFECT: MORE STAMPING OF FEET.

HOLMES: There we are.

WATSON: Not much left of it. Just a twisted metal frame.

HOLMES: But enough to give us a clue. Look here --

WATSON: A gold band!

HOLMES: Exactly, and on it the initials "W.R."

WATSON: William Rush! The missing man's umbrella! And it must have been put in the furnace only a few minutes ago. The fabric was still flaring as we came down here.

HOLMES: Obviously someone was trying to dispose of very incriminating evidence.

WATSON: But who'd be here at this time of the night except --

STANLEY: (FADING IN -- AGGRESSIVELY) Who's down here? I've got a revolver, so don't try any tricks!

HOLMES: Captain Rush --

STANLEY: Mr. Sherlock Holmes! What in blazes d' you think you're doing in the basement at three o'clock in the morning?

WATSON: We're searching for evidence -- and we've found some.

STANLEY: How did you get in?

HOLMES: I . . . er . . . took the liberty of using a skeleton key. I didn't want to disturb anyone.

STANLEY: You're just a couple of house-breakers! I'm going to send for the police! Go on move up those stairs!

WATSON: But this is ridiculous! My friend was asked to investigate the case!

STANLEY: I didn't ask him. Go on -- get moving!

WATSON: But --

HOLMES: I suggest you do as the Captain orders, Watson. He still has a revolver pointing at you, you know.

SOUND EFFECT: FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS

WATSON: Outrageous -- treating us like a couple of criminals.

STANLEY: I never wanted you brought in on this case. The police are perfectly capable of handling the matter, and that's what I'll tell Lestrade when he gets here.

HOLMES: If you're sending for Lestrade, I wonder if you'd mind asking him to bring Nathan Black with him. If you insist on having a party, I feel that we should have all sides of the case equally represented.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

LESTRADE: (REPROACHFULLY) What's this Captain Rush has been telling me, Mr. Holmes? Breaking into people's houses at three in the morning? You and Doctor Watson ought to know better than that, y'know.

HOLMES: I had excellent reasons. Good evening, Mr. Black.

BLACK: What's good about it? Dragging people out of bed at this hour --

STANLEY: Yes, Mr. Holmes, I think you'd better explain what the devil you think you're up to.

HOLMES: Gentlemen, I am trying to discover what became of William Rush. Doctor Watson and I came here tonight in search of evidence. Here it is . . . this twisted umbrella frame.

BLACK: That's William's umbrella --

HOLMES: You have remarkable eyesight, Mr. Black. The only thing that identifies it are the initials on the gold band. But you're right -- it is William Rush's umbrella.

LESTRADE: Where did you find it, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: In the furnace.

BLACK: I see it now, Stanley! You murdered William because you were in love with Isabel. You disposed of his body and tonight you were trying to dispose of the rest of the evidence, you scoundrel!

STANLEY: (MENACINGLY) I murdered Bill? Why Nathan, you low-down --

BLACK: D'you deny that you're in love with Isabel?

STANLEY: Keep her out of this!

HOLMES: I'm afraid we can't, Captain Rush. That's a pertinent question and I think you should answer it.

LESTRADE: So do I, Mr. Holmes. Now Captain Rush -- were you in love with your sister-in-law?

STANLEY: Yes. But Bill didn't know -- and I'd never have broken his heart by telling him.

BLACK: No, you wouldn't break his heart -- you'd just murder him!

STANLEY: (FURIOUSLY) You killed him yourself. Just as you murdered my father!

SOUND EFFECT: SCUFFLE

LESTRADE: Here here, gentlemen. Take it easy.

WATSON: Yes, indeed, you'll settle nothing by murdering each other.

HOLMES: Since you each accuse the other, there's one very simple way of solving this matter.

WATSON: What's that, Holmes?

HOLMES: I want each of you to sign a confession that you did away with William, and then lied about what happened.

STANLEY: But that's ridiculous!

BLACK: Of course it is.

HOLMES: No, it isn't. You have nothing to lose gentlemen, either of you, because since both these confessions can't be true, only one can be damaging -- [if] it's corroborated.

STANLEY: But to sign a confession -- that's an admission of guilt!

HOLMES: Only if you are guilty, Captain Rush.

WATSON: Both the confessions can't be valid, y'know.

BLACK: What are you going to do with two confessions?

HOLMES: That I shall demonstrate to you after I have the confessions. Now, I see pen and papers on the writing desk over there. If you'll write what I dictate, please: "I hereby confess that I murdered William Rush and lied about what happened to him." And now sign it, please.

BLACK: (OFF A LITTLE) I must say, Mr. Holmes, this seems the most arrant nonsense. (FADING IN) Here you are.

HOLMES: Thank you.

STANLEY: I hope you know what you're doing. (FADING IN) Here.

HOLMES: I shall confront your separate partners with these confessions and see what they say -- In Captain Rush's case, it will be Mrs. Rush, and in Mr. Black's case, it will be Taylor, his coachman. Lestrade, will you go upstairs and ask Mrs. Rush to come down here, please?

LESTRADE: (FADING) Certainly, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Mr. Black, I presume your coachman, Taylor, is waiting for you?

BLACK: Yes, he's outside. I'll fetch him.

HOLMES: Thank you. I prefer to fetch him myself.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR OPEN. FOOTSTEPS DOWN STEPS

HOLMES: (CALLING) Taylor! Taylor!

TAYLOR: (FADING IN. SLEEPILY) Yes guv'nor -- Aow! It's you!

HOLMES: Yes. It's me. I want you to read this very simple document just written by your employer. You can read it in the light of your cab lamp.

TAYLOR: (STARTING TO READ WITH DIFFICULTY) "I hereby . . . confess . . . I murdered -- " 'Ere! Wot's 'e think -- ?

BLACK: (FADING IN, SMOOTHLY) Oh no, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You don't really think I'm such a fool, do you? Feel this gun against your ribs? Don't think of turning round, will you?

HOLMES: I have no intention of -- (WITH A SUDDEN GRUNT OF EXERTION) -- turning round!

SOUND EFFECT: SCUFFLE. REVOLVER SHOT

HOLMES: Rather a neat trick, don't you think? It was taught to me by a Japanese wrestler. Now that you've dropped your revolver, I'll borrow it if you don't mind. I suggest that you both stand under the gaslight where I can keep my eyes on you. Thank you. By the way, Taylor -- give me back that confession, will you? I think Inspector Lestrade will find it interesting evidence.

WATSON: (FADING IN EXCITEDLY) Holmes! Are you all right?

HOLMES: Perfectly, thank you, old chap. 

WATSON: But that shot?

HOLMES: I'm afraid I spoiled Mr. Black's aim.

STANLEY: (FADING IN) What's going on, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: There, Captain Rush, are the two men who can tell you the true story of your brother's fate. Will you tell him, Mr. Black?

BLACK: I refuse to talk without a lawyer present.

HOLMES: Then let me reconstruct the case. Obviously, William never went back to the house. Nathan Black and Taylor silenced him as he got into the carriage and, after a suitable pause, went in and produced the false story that he had returned for his umbrella.

WATSON: Then why did we discover the burning umbrella in the furnace earlier on?

HOLMES: Undoubtedly Mr. Black or his servant Taylor brought it back in the hopes the burning remnants would incriminate Captain Rush. In fact, if we hadn't interrupted them earlier, I'm pretty well certain Mr. Black planned to be 'round in the morning, suggesting that we search the furnace.

STANLEY: I don't care about all that. What I want to know is what's happened to Bill!

HOLMES: Tell him, Taylor.

BLACK: Keep your mouth shut!

TAYLOR: Naow! I won't. You think becos' you pay me ten quid you can shove the blame off on me. Well, you can't, see? 'Eres what 'appened, gents. The bloke gets in the carriage and Mr. Black slips this pad wiv' chloroform on his face, an' he goes to sleep, an' we hide him under the rugs. Later on we drives out to Putney. On the ways I hears a shot in the carriage, and when we gets to a quiet spot just below the bridge . . . we stops and throws the poor bloke in the river.

STANLEY: (VIOLENTLY) Why, Nathan you --

SOUND EFFECT: CRACK OF FIST ON JAW. GROAN, FALLING BODY

HOLMES: I can't say I blame you, Captain Rush. But I suggest you leave this pair to us while you go back and break the news to Mrs. Rush.

STANLEY: Very well Mr, Holmes . . . (FADING) I'll do that.

LESTRADE: (FADING IN EXCITEDLY) Mr. Holmes -- what's going on?

HOLMES: Ah, Scotland Yard -- late as usual. The case is solved, Lestrade.

LESTRADE: Solved? But who --

HOLMES: The dormant Mr. Black is your murderer, and that cringing apology of a man Taylor is an accessory.

LESTRADE: But why --

HOLMES: Come now, Lestrade. I can't provide you with both the criminals and the motive at this time of the morning. Here is the confession. I suggest that you have Taylor drive you and your evidence over to Scotland Yard.

WATSON: Good idea, Holmes. Here, Lestrade. I'll give you a hand with getting Mr. Black into the carriage . . . .

SOUND EFFECT: EXERTION

WATSON: There we are . . . .

LESTRADE: Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Mr. Holmes. Once again you've helped me out of a very tight place.

HOLMES: Not at all, dear fellow. I'm glad to have been of service. I'll be round at the Yard in the morning.

LESTRADE: (FADING) Good night, gentlemen.

HOLMES and WATSON: Good night.

SOUND EFFECT: CAB DOOR CLOSES

LESTRADE: (OFF A LITTLE ) All right, Taylor. Off you go . . . and no funny tricks. I've got a revolver, remember.

HOLMES: Oh, Lestrade --

LESTRADE: (OFF) Yes, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Sure you don't want to take us with you?

LESTRADE: How d'you mean, sir?

HOLMES: After all . . . technically we're criminals. We're guilty of housebreaking, you know.

LESTRADE: (LAUGHING) That's all right, Mr. Holmes. Just this once I think we can overlook that!

MUSIC: UP STRONG TO FINAL CURTAIN

FORMAN: Well, Doctor, that was an unusual story. And I must say I was a bit surprised at the outcome.

WATSON: Surprised -- in what respect?

FORMAN: Well -- to tell the truth, I thought Stanley Rush was guilty -- not Nathan Black.

WATSON: Why did you think that?

FORMAN: Well -- Stanley looked so rough and uncouth, while Black looked every bit the gentleman.

WATSON: (LAUGHS) I'm afraid you're as bad a detective as I am. You know, determining a man's character is like determining the character of a wine. You don't judge a man by the clothes he wears any more than you judge a wine by the glass it's served in.

FORMAN: Well -- get him! Dr. Watson, the philosopher. (LAUGHS) But you've got something there, Doctor. A good wine does taste good in any kind of glass, and that's particularly true about Petri California Wine. You can serve Petri wine in water tumblers or even tea cups and it will still be clear, fragrant and delicious. That's because the Petri family really knows how to make good wine. They've been making wine for generations -- ever since they first started the Petri business way back in the eighteen-hundreds. And because their business has always been a family affair -- well, they've been able to hand on down in the family -- from father to son, from father to son -- everything they've ever learned about the art of making fine wine. Yes sir -- the Petri family knows all there is to know about turning plump, hand-picked grapes into wonderful wine. That's why you can't go wrong with a Petri wine . . . because Petri took time to bring you good wine! And now, Doctor Watson, how's about a clue to next week's story?

WATSON: Next week, Mr. Forman, I'm going to tell you about a strange and terrifying adventure that Sherlock Holmes and I had on the rocky coasts of Cornwall. It concerns a most unusual house, two brothers -- and a werewolf!

MUSIC: SCOTCH POEM

FORMAN: Tonight's Sherlock Holmes adventure is written by Denis Green and Bruce Taylor and is based on an incident in the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story, "The Adventure of the Empty House". Mr. Rathbone appears through the courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Mr. Bruce through the courtesy of Universal Pictures, where they are now starring in the Sherlock Holmes series.

MUSIC: THEME UP AND DOWN UNDER

FORMAN: The Petri Wine Company of San Francisco, California invites you to tune in again next, week, same time, same station.

MUSIC: HIT JINGLE

SINGERS: Oh, the Petri family took the time, to bring you such good wine, so when you eat and when you cook, Remember Petri Wine!

FORMAN: Yes, Petri Wine made by the Petri Wine Company, San Francisco, California.

SINGERS: Pet -- Pet -- Petri . . . Wine.

FORMAN: This is Bill Forman saying goodnight for the Petri family. Sherlock Holmes comes to you from the Don Lee studios in Hollywood. This is the Mutual Broadcasting Network!
Forman: Petri Wine brings you...

(Music: Theme...Fade on Cue)

Forman: Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in the new adventures on Sherlock Holmes.

(Music: Theme...Full Finish)

(Insert opening commercial)

Forman: And now let's look in on the genial doctor Watson, and see what a story he has waiting for us. Good evening, Doctor.

Watson: 'Evening, Mr. Forman. Take you coat off...and your scarf...and your gloves...and your goloshes...That's it. (Chuckling) It's certainly raining cats and dogs tonight. Come and sit by the fire and warm yourself up.

Forman: Thank you Doctor. All set for tonight's story?

Watson: Yes, I'm "all set," as you say.

Forman: Last week you told us your adventure took place in the south of France.

Watson: Yes, Mr. Forman, and if you can imagine yourself basking in the sunshine of the Riviera with Holmes and myself in the early nineteen-hundreds, perhaps it'll help you forget what a beastly night it is outside.

Forman: I've forgotten that already, Doctor. How did your story begin?

Watson: Simple enough. Holmes and I were staying in Nice, when we were visited at our hotel by a young Englishman, the Honourable Reginald Shipton. The boy was in serious trouble and had come to Holmes for help.

Forman: And I'm sure he got it.

Watson: He did, though in giving it, Holmes was arrested for murder!

Forman: For murder?! Say, Doctor, how did a thing like that happen to the great Sherlock Holmes?

Watson: That's just what I'm going to tell you. The boy had become involved with a...a rather notorious French lady-Madame Corvey. She was much older than he, though I must admit she was a glamorous creature, and the boy's infatuation was understandable...at least (chuckling) I found it so. Unfortunately, he had given the lady an exquisite diamond and sapphire necklace [sic] that was a family heirloom...although he overlooked the fact that he had not yet inherited it.

Forman: Then of course he had no right to make the gift?

Watson: Of course he hadn't...and when his father, Lord Shipton, learned what had happened he threatened to disinherit him unless he got the necklace back...and so, the boy came to Homes with his problem. At first, the great man tried the ordinary methods of handling the case. He approached Madame Corvey directly and was told to mind his own business. He tried persuasion, deception...he even went to the police, but to no avail. Finally, one night...he disappeared. I was frantic, because I knew he was in danger, and so I got in touch with the police. Within half an hour Inspector Charel telephoned me to come over to Madame Corvey's villa at once-that Holmes was in serious trouble.

Forman: And of course you rushed over there.

Watson: As fast as a carriage would carry me. My fears increased as I drew up at the villa and saw a cordon of police guarding the building. But as I got inside and saw my old friend, a cold terror struck at my heart. There he was in the library, Madame Corvey lying at his feet, with her throat slashed...and in Holmes's hand was a bloodstained dagger! You can imagine what Monsieur Charel, the chief of police, (fading) said as I came in...

Charel: (About forty-five...cold...precise...French accent) Dr.

Watson...Your famous friend has made his last mistake.

Watson: Great Heavens! What's going on. (Urgently) Holmes! Tell me!

Holmes: Madame Corvey has been murdered, Watson, and unfortunately our friend, Monsieur Charel, seems to be under the impression that I killed her.

Watson: But that's utterly ridiculous!

Charel: Is it? Then how do you account for the fact when we came here just now, Mr. Holmes was standing here alone with a corpse?
Watson: (Exasperated) Well, Holmes...Why don't you explain what happened?

Holmes: I've already done so but Monsieur Charel doesn't seem to believe me. However...for your benefit...I came back here to try and have another talk with Madame Corvey, I found the front door open and walked in...to discover the safe looted, and its owner stabbed to death. I picked up the dagger from the floor to examine it, and as I did so, Monsieur Charel and police came in.

Charel: I should have thought a great detective like you, Monsieur Holmes, could have thought up a more ingenious lie than that. (Calling in French) Take him away to the suretee [sic]!

Gendarme: (In French) Come along, Monsieur.

Watson: (hotly) Tell that policeman to take his hands off you, Holmes!
Holmes: But I haven't the right to, my dear chap. You see, just before you arrived, Monsieur Charel had (fading) arrested me for murder.
Watson: And there my old friend was, spending the night in custody. 
Forman: And I suppose you stayed there right with him, Doctor.
Watson: Not for long, Mr. Forman. He...He-eh-gave me a little job to do. Let me tell you just what happened. The next morning found us in the office of the Prefect of Police. There we were...Holmes and I...Inspector Charel...and the various witnesses connected with the case. It was a strange sight as Holmes stood there (fading) defending himself...

(Fade in babble of voices. Raps of gavel.)

Prefect: Quiet! Quiet!

(Babble of voices subsiding.)

Prefect: (Elderly, accent. Off a little, on slight echo) Monsieur Sherlock Holmes is an eminent visitor to our country. That is why this preliminary investigation is being held in private. Thought he has been caught under extremely incriminating circumstances, let us at least extend him the courtesy of a fair hearing. Proceed, Mr. Holmes. You have told us that you were brought into the case in the fist place at the request of the Honourable Reginald Shipton. Am I right?

Holmes: Yes, Monsieur Le Prefect.

Prefect: Is the honourable Reginald Shipton present?

Reggie: (Fading in...English...young) Here, Monsieur Le Prefect.

Prefect: Do you corroborate the evidence so far given by Monsieur Holmes?

Reggie: Yes...he's told the truth so far. (violently) But, if I'd known then that he was going to murder Madame Corvey...I'd have strangled him myself!

(Rap of gavel)

Prefect: Quiet! Please confine yourself to answering questions.

Proceed, Mr. Holmes. What was your next move?

Holmes: To meet Madame Corvey and try and reason with her.

Prefect: and how did you accomplish this aim?

Holmes: My client informed me that Madame Corvey was giving a large ball at her villa that night. I suggested that he take my old friend Doctor Watson and myself along with him to meet the lady.

Prefect: And did you meet her?

Holmes: Oh yes, M. Le Prefect. We arrived about eight o'clock to find a crowd of a hundred and fifty people or more, dancing (fading) to the music of a string orchestra...

(String orchestra concluding a polka)

Watson: (After music is established) A very distinguished gathering, Mr. Shipton. Madame Corvey must be extremely popular.

Reggie: (Bitterly) Too confoundedly popular for my liking, Doctor Watson.

(Orchestra finishes. Applause. Chatter of voices in B. G.)

Holmes: Where is Madam Corvey? I should like to meet her as soon as possible. These affairs are not much in my line.

Watson: (Mumbling) I think it's rather gay, if you ask me.

Duc: (Fading in. Elderly. Stupid, with an irritating giggle) Hello,

Reginald. I was not expecting to see you here.

Reggie: (Sourly) I'm sorry to surprise you.

Duc: Won't you introduce me to your friends?

Reggie: Monsieur Le Duc de Boncourt...Mr. Holmes, and Doctor Watson.

(Ad lib how d'you dos.)

Duc: All here to worship at the shrine of Venus I suppose? (he thrills with revolting laughter) By the way, Reginald, I thought you had received your conge. From what Yvette told me today it seemed that...

Reginald: (Interrupting brusquely) I'm afraid we're in a bit of a hurry. Good evening, Monsieur Le Duc.

Duc: (Fading) Not jealous of me, are you, Reginald? (he laughs again)

Watson: Pon' [sic] my soul, my boy, you were extraordinarily rude to him, if y'don't mind my saying so.

Reginald: He's an insufferable old ass and I can't stand him. He thinks that because Yvette smiles at him for the moment that he's going to marry her.

Holmes: The Duc is the current favourite, I take it?

Charel: (Fading in) Ah, Monsieur Sherlock Holmes. How are you?

Holmes: I'm afraid I don't know you, monsieur.

Charel: No...but I know you...and your friend Doctor Watson.

Watson: Oh really, I don't remember meeting you, sir.

Reggie: This is Monsieur Charel-inspector of the suretee [sic]

(Ad lib how d'you dos from Watson and Holmes.)

Charel: When distinguished rivals honour my town with their presence! Monsieur Holmes, I make it my business to recognize them.

Holmes: That's very flattering of you.

Charel: Not at all. You're not here on business, I suppose.

Holmes: (lightly) Oh dear me no. On pleasure, monsieur. Purely on pleasure.

Charel: Splendid. You will find Madame Corvey's parties enchanting, I'm sure. (Fading) Au revoir, messieurs.

Watson: Charming fellow.

Reggie: Do you think so? He's just another old fool who thinks Yvette's in love with him. (Suddenly) There's Yvette now. Come on...I'll introduce you. And then I'll get out of the way. I don't want to talk to her more than I have to.

(String orchestra starting an old fashioned two-step)

Reggie: (Calling) Yvette!

Yvette: (Fading in) (gay, sophisticated, charming Frenchwoman in the early forties) Reginald! 'Ow nice to see you. I did not know you were coming.

Reggie: I changed my mind. Yvette...I want you to meet two friends of mine. Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson.

Yvette: Enchante, messieurs.

Holmes: How d'you do, Madame Corvey.

Watson: (Audibly smitten) I'm extremely glad to meet you, Madame.

Reggie: They want to talk to you privately, (fading) so I'll leave you.

Yvette: Reginald, you silly boy, come back 'ere! (After a moment) (with a laugh) He is so young, isn't he? Youth has a charm all of its own, messieurs...but for a woman like myself I find it a little trying...for too long at one time. It is more soothing to be with people my own age, like yourselves.

Watson: (Burbling happily) Awfully nice of you to say so, Madame. But I know we're both a great deal older than you are. (He laughs rogueishly)

Yvette: Nonsense. But your friend-he has-'ow you say-the long face...What is the matter, Mr. 'Olmes?

Holmes: Nothing , madame...except that I'd like to have a little business talk with you.

Yvette: Business?! With this music playing? No, no, no. Your friend shall dance with me.

Watson: I shall be very proud to take you for a twirl. Madame Corvey. (Modestly)

Holmes: Forgive me, Madame...and Watson, old chap, but I must insist on this business talk first.

Yvette: Business! You are very tiresome...but because I like your friend, I will talk business with you. Come and sit over'ere....(After a pause)

Holmes: The diamond and sapphire necklace you are wearing, madame. I presume it's the one Lord Shipton's son gave you?

Yvette: (Her tone changing) Yes. What of it?

Holmes: D'you mind if I examine it?

Yvette: Yes, I do-very much. What are you? A diamond buyer.

Holmes: No, I am a friend of Mr. Shipton's. He asked me to try and persuade you to return the necklace to him. 

Yvette: The insolent puppy! It is mine. He gave it to me-in front of witnesses.

Holmes: He had no right to, Madame. It did not belong to him.

Yvette: Then he is a thief...and that is no concern of mine. He made a gift, and I accepted it.

Holmes: Would you consider...er...selling back your gift?

Yvette: No! I would not!

Holmes: Are you sure? Reginald would pay a fair price for it...(meaningly [sic]) and it may have depreciated in value since you received it, you know.

Yvette: (Angrily) Go away! Go away before I have you thrown out!

Watson: (Embarrassed) I'm awfully sorry, Madame. My friend's really a....

Yvette: Go away both of you! (Fading) You bore me!

Watson: (After a moment) 'Pon my soul! Never seen a woman change her tune so quickly. Fascinating creature, though. If there's one thing I like in a woman it's spirit.

Holmes: Rubbish! Madame Corvey's an adventuress.

Watson: Why d'you say that, Holmes?

Holmes: Because, although she wouldn't let me examine the necklace, I was able to detect that the diamonds have been replaced by imitations.

Watson: Good land! You mean that she sold the originals?

Holmes: Undoubtedly. Sold them-or kept them.

Reggie: (Fading in excitedly) Mr. Holmes!

Holmes: Yes, my boy? I was just looking for you. What's wrong?

Reggie: I want to leave here at once. I've just heard that Yvette's going to announce her engagement to the Duc de Boncourt tonight. I don't want to stay to hear it.

Holmes: I quite understand. Though if I were you, I would be relieved rather than upset by the announcement.

Reggie: What did she say to you when you asked her about the necklace, Mr. Holmes?

Holmes: Very little. But I have a feeling that you might be able to but it back for a reasonable sum.

Reggie: But I've tried that...and she wouldn't part with it.

Holmes: Try again, my dear boy. I think my little conversation with her tonight, might cause her to change her opinion as to its market value.

(Orchestra up, then down and out.)

(Fading in) Hubbub of voices. Rap of gavel.

Prefect: Quiet! Quiet! Pray continue Mr. Holmes. What happened next?

Holmes: Early the next morning Shipton came round to see me with the information that he had recovered the necklace for a very reasonable sum.

Prefect: Did you tell him that the diamonds had been replaced?

Holmes: No. Monsieur. I didn't.

Prefect: Why not?

Holmes: I felt that before I told him anything about Madame Corvey with any degree of authority, it was only fair to re-inforce my beliefs with facts.

Prefect: So what did you do?

Holmes: The obvious thing. After all, I have no official standing in your country, and yet I knew Madame Corvey was a criminal...or perhaps I should say-an adventuress. And so I decided to pay a visit to Monsieur Charel-the head inspector of your local police. After my client left, Doctor Watson and I went round to Monsieur Charel's office. (Fading) He seemed to be very pleased to see us...
Charel: Ah, Monsieur Sherlock Holmes...and his friend. Come in. I am very flattered that you come to see me.

(Holmes and Watson ad lib how d'you dos.)

Charel: Is this a business visit, messieurs, or am I to suppose that you come here to make my acquaintance better?

Holmes: A little of both, Monsieur.

Charel: Please tell me what I can do for you?

Holmes: Monsieur Charel, I was not [t]elling you the truth at Madame Corvey's party last night when I said I was there purely on pleasure.

Charel: I was well aware of that, monsieur.

Watson: But how could you...

Charel: (Smoothly) Doctor Watson, very little goes on in this town that I am not aware of. 

Holmes: Perhaps you know why I was at the party?

Charel: But of course.

Holmes: And did you know that this morning Madame Corvey parted with the necklace...in consideration of a cash payment?

Charel: No, I did not know. But it is her own affair. Is your client satisfied with his bargain?

Holmes: Perfectly...but, you see, he doesn't know that the diamonds have been removed and replaced with imitations. I noticed that when I was talking to Madame Corvey last night.

Charel: Had you ever seen the necklace before?

Holmes: No.

Charel: How do you know that the necklace ever was valuable? You have said your client is satisfied. What do you wish me to do?

Holmes: I should like you to investigate Madame Corvey.

Charel: (Coldly) Monsieur Holmes; Yvette Corvey is a brilliant and distinguished woman. Duels have been fought over her. Kings have paid homage to her. And now, because some stupid English boy has had trouble over a paltry necklace, you expect me to investigate her? In France, Monsieur Holmes, we police do not work without evidence, and I think it will be good for you to remember that fact. (Fading) Good day, messieurs....

(Chatter of voices. Gavel. Chatter subsides.)

Prefect: And then what happened, Monsieur Holmes, after you had left Inspector Charel's office?

Holmes: Monsieur le Prefect, I was deeply dissatisfied. I knew in my own mind that Madame Corvey was guilty. and so I decided to pay her another visit.

Prefect: Why did you go alone? Your friend Doctor Watson had been with you during your previous expeditions.

Holmes: I intended to burgle the safe, and I didn't want to incriminate my old friend in such a risky proceeding.

Prefect: You admit you went there to burgle the safe?

Holmes: Yes, Monsieur le Prefect. But, of course, when I got there, someone had rifled the safe before me-and murdered Madame Corvey.

Prefect: Please tell me exactly what happened. 

Holmes: I arrived at the villa just after midnight. Perhaps I should explain the villa is built around a courtyard in such a way that, short of smashing one of the ground floor windows, there are only two ways in-a door on the street-and a door at the back which opens on to the beach.

Prefect: And which way had you proposed to try and enter?

Holmes: From the beach...but, as I approached from that direction, I noticed a light still burning in the library, and so I circled the house to investigate the chances of entering through the front door with the aid of a skeleton key. As I did so, I noticed to my surprise that the door was open a fraction. Of course...I went in.... 

(Music: sneaks in underscoring dialogue.)

Holmes: I tip-toed along the hallway.

(Furtive footsteps on wood)

Holmes: Everything was quiet.... Suddenly I stumbled over something.

(Shuffle of footsteps)

Holmes: It was a body.

(Music: knife chord, then down and under)

Holmes: I struck a match.

(Match being struck)

Holmes: It was the Duc de Boncourt. At first, I thought he was dead, but when I turned him over I realized he was unconscious. I decided to investigate a little further and so I walked towards the library....

(Footsteps on Wood)

Holmes: (After a pause) I opened the door and went in.

(Door open. Footsteps stop.)

(Music: Chord, then down.)

Holmes: The lights were on....and I saw Madame Corvey lying on the rug in front of the fire with her throat slashed, and a dagger lying beside her. The wall-safe near the bookcase was open...and empty. I stooped down and touched Madame Corvey..her body was still warm. Then I picked up the dagger-by its blade-and started to examine it. As I did so...I heard a rattling at the French windows leading to the courtyard.

(Rattling of windows, off)

Holmes: Of course...it was Inspector Charel.

(Music: Up strong and out cold.)

(Windows being wrenched open. Approaching footsteps.)

Charel: (Fading in excitedly) Sherlock Holmes! I've caught you red-handed!

Holmes: Please don't wave that revolver at me, Monsieur Charel.

Charel: Madame Corvey! Is she...?

Holmes: Yes...she's dead...murdered.

Charel: You did it!

Holmes: Don't be ridiculous!

Charel: Then how is it that I find you along with the murdered woman-and with the weapon in your hand!

Holmes: It's very easily explained. I came here to...

(Running footsteps approaching.)

Charel: Who's that?...The Honourable Reginald Shipton! How did you get in here?

Reggie: (Fading in, excitedly) The door was open. I ... (Hysterically) Yvette! Yvette!

Holmes: I'm afraid she's been murdered, my boy.

Reggie: Murdered?! But who...?

Charel: Judge for yourself, monsieur!

Reggie: Holmes! Holmes, you filthy...

(Scuffle.)

Holmes: Don't be a fool! Use a little intelligence!

(Struggle increased.)

Reggie: Yvette's dead! You killed her!

Charel: (In French) Take him outside.

(Scuffle subsiding.)

Charel: Monsieur Holmes, before I telephone for your friend, Doctor Watson, I must indulge in a slight formality.

Holmes: And what's that, inspector?

Charel: I arrest you for the murder of Madame Yvette Corvey!

(Music: Up strong to curtain.)

(Insert middle commercial)

Forman: And now, back to tonight's new Sherlock Holmes adventure. The great detective, and his old friend Doctor Watson, are in the south of France where they have become involved in a strange case connected with a famous adventuress-Yvette Corvey. Holmes, having failed in his preliminary investigations, has decided to pay a call on the lady, alone and after midnight, but in doing so has landed himself in serious trouble, for he has found Madame Corvey murdered and himself arrested for the crime. As we rejoin our story, the Prefect of Police is (fading) conducting an official trial....

(Chatter of voices, raps of gavel. Chatter subsides.)

Prefect: Monsieur Holmes, we have heard your evidence as to how you entered the villa and found the body of Madame Corvey. You realize, of course, that your story is entirely uncorroborated?

Holmes: Yes, I do, Monsieur le Prefect.

Prefect: You stated that you found M. le Duc de Boncourt, lying in the hallway, unconscious, as you entered the house.

Holmes: Yes, Monsieur le Prefect.

Prefect: Is the Duc de Boncourt present?

Duc: (Fading in) Oui, Monsieur le Prefee.

Prefect: What is your own story regarding last night's tragedy?

Duc: I had taken Yvette to the ballet. We came back about eleven thirty. The servants were in bed, but they had left a snack for us-some cold fowl and a bottle of champagne. Just before midnight, we decided to have a little more champagne and so I started off to the cellar. As I came into the hallway, I suddenly received a violent blow on the head...and I don't remember any more until the police revived me.

Prefect: I see. Thank you, Monsieur le Duc. Is the honourable Reginald Shipton here?

Reggie: (Fading in) Yes, Monsieur le Prefect.

Prefect: What were you doing at Madame Corvey's villa last night, monsieur? It has already been testified that you had received your necklace back....

Reggie: (In a low voice) I, ...I...came over to try and persuade her to change her mind...to throw over the Duc de Boncourt...and marry me. When I came to the house...The door was open...I walked in...and found poor Yvette murdered. 

Prefect: I see. Thank you, monsieur. (After a moment) Inspector Charel, I cannot help but feel that you have produced a very inconclusive case against Monsieur Sherlock Holmes. It seems to me that both the Duc de Boncourt and the Hon. Reginald Shipton had equal opportunities, and greater motive to murder Madame Corvey than he did.
Duc: (off. Excitedly) Monsieur le Prefee! Que dites moi?!

Reggie: But that's ridiculous! I loved Yvette! I'd never have...

(Rap of gavel. Voices subside.)

Prefect: Quiet! (After a moment) I did not say that you gentlemen did it. I'm saying that you both had the opportunity.

Holmes: Monsieur le Prefect...as I am under arrest, may I have the privilege of proving myself innocent?

Prefect: Mais certainment, monsieur...if you can.

Holmes: I think the identity of the murderer will be obvious when we find the jewels stolen from Madame Corvey's safe. Now the three people present at, or about, the time of the lady's murder-were searched: myself-the Duc-and Mr. Shipton here. Am I right Inspector Charel?

Charel: Yes, monsieur, and the jewels were not found-so what does that prove?

Holmes: One other person that had a motive for killing Madame Corvey was not searched-yourself, Inspector.

(Excited buzz of voices.)

Charel: (Angrily) But this is outrageous! Are you accusing me?


(Rap of gavel. Voices subside.)

Prefect: Monsieur Holmes, do you realize the significance of what you are implying?

Holmes: I do, Monsieur le Prefect.

Prefect: Very well then. Proceed.

Holmes: Monsieur Charel, you stated that the beach gate was bolted. How did you find that out?

Charel: By trying it.

Holmes: From inside-or outside?

Charel: From outside, of course.

Holmes: I don't believe you. I think that when Doctor Watson telephoned your office you suspected where I might be going. You hurried ahead of the gendarmes and reached the Villa several minutes before I did. You found the beach gate was open...you saw Madame Corvey putting her jewels away, as Monsieur le Duc de Boncourt started to leave the room to go the cellar. You slipped through the windows, signaled to Madame Corvey, who was your confederate, to be silent...followed the Duc into the hall and struck him from behind. Then you went back into the library, killed Madame Corvey, and pocketed the jewels. You started to leave the front way...and saw me approaching. Seeing a chance to implicate me, you left the door ajar...and ran out the beach way, bolting the door behind you, and waited for your reinforcements.

Charel: You have convicted yourself! If you came to the villa after I was there-how could you have known what my movements were? 

Holmes: I admit that this part of my case is only supposition.

Prefect: But Monsieur Holmes, that is no evidence.

Charel: Of course it is not!

Holmes: Now I'll come to my facts. Doctor Watson, I wonder if you'd mind stepping forward?

Watson: (fading in) I'm very glad to. In fact, I've been wondering why you haven't asked me to before, Holmes.

Holmes: Will you please tell Monsieur le Prefect exactly what you did last night after I was brought here.

Watson: With pleasure. (Raising his voice slightly) Monsieur le Prefect, my old friend Mr. Holmes told me to shadow Inspector Charel as soon as he left the Suretee [sic] last night. And that's what I did...He walked down to the waterfront and entered a small caf?....I watched through the window and saw him give a package to a rough-looking sailor-and a few minutes later he left. Holmes had told me what to expect...so I followed the sailor. He went down to the wharf....I was behind him with a revolver in my pocket. As he started to get into a fishing boat....I captured him...and also these...

(Chatter of excited voices. Gavel.)

Holmes: You'll find, Monsieur Le Prefect, that those ate the missing jewels.

Charel: That is a lie! He is lying to save his friend!

Watson: Oh, no, I'm not! The fisherman is waiting outside the room now.

Prefect: Have him brought in!

(Footsteps. Chatter of voices.)

Henri: (About fifty. French accent. Voluble) (Fading in) Henri Borel has done nothing! Only what Monsieur Charel pays him to do...and now he is brought into the surette [sic] like a criminal!

(Commotion. Gavel. Voices subside.)

Prefect: Henri Borel...are those the jewels the ones that were given to you by Monsieur Charel last night?

Henri: Oui, Monsieur le Prefee! But you must no blame me. I only do what I am told to do...to sail with them to Corsica and give them to Monsieur Charel's brother. Just as I have done a hundred times before.

Charel: (violently) He lies! I have never seen him in my life!

Henri: I lie? Henri Baptiste Borel, born in your own home town of Ajaccio...I that have known you since you were a boy? Sacre nom du chien, monsieur...what game do you play?!

Holmes: Monsieur le Prefect...the dagger on the table in front of you...may I show it to this man?

Prefect: Of course.

Holmes: (After a moment) Henri Borel...have you ever seen this dagger before?

Henri: Mais oui! Of course I have seen it. My brother made it. He is the finest sword maker in Ajaccio...he made it for Monsieur Charel....
Watson: (Suddenly) Look out! Charel! He's drawing his revolver! Stop him!

(Revolver shot)

(Music: Up fast into bridge.)

(Footsteps on cobblestones.)

Watson: (After footsteps are established) Well, Holmes, Charel solved it for you very simply by committing suicide.

Holmes: Oh, no, Watson, it was already solved...thanks to your very excellent sleuthing.

Watson: (Bumbling happily) I didn't do anything much. Holmes. Just what you told me to. By the way...I still don't understand Charel's motive for murdering Madame Corvey.

Holmes: It was a combination of motives. Jealousy at her announcing her engagement to the Duc...and anger at realizing that she had replaced the jewels in Lord Shipton's heirloom without telling him. Henri Borel made it very clear tonight that they had been [in] partnership as smugglers for years.

Watson: One of our most unusual cases. (Facetiously) You know, Holmes, for a while, I was afraid you were going to end up in the guillotine!

Holmes: (Chuckling) Did you really, old fellow? By the way, there was a certain poetic justice about the case.

Watson: In what way?!

Holmes: Did you notice that Charel's dagger has an inscription on the blade?

Watson: Yes...but I couldn't translate it.

Holmes: It said: "Che la mia ferita sia mortale."

Watson: And what does that mean, Holmes?

Holmes: "Let my wound be mortal."

(Music: Up strong to curtain.)

Campbell: Tonight's Sherlock Holmes adventure is written by Denis Green and Bruce Taylor and is based on an incident in the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story, "The Adventure of the Illustrious Client." Mr. Rathbone appears through the courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Mr. Bruce through the courtesy of Universal Pictures where they are now starring in the Sherlock Holmes series.

(Music: Theme up and down under)

Campbell: (Out) The Petri Wine Company of San Francisco, California, invites you to tune in again next week, same time, same station.
ANNOUNCER: This episode from the life of Sherlock Holmes will be transmitted to our men and women overseas by short wave and through the worldwide facilities of the Armed Forces Radio Service. Petri Wine brings you--

MUSIC: FANFARE

ANNOUNCER: Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in "The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."

MUSIC: FANFARE ... THEN OUT

ANNOUNCER: The Petri Family -- "the family that took time / to bring you good wine" -- invites you to listen to Dr. Watson tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective, Sherlock Holmes. And, while you're settling back comfortably in your chair, mind if I tell you about something I'd like you to share with me? It's a glass of Petri California sherry. Of course, most people think of Petri California sherry as the one wine that's really swell any time but, personally, I like a glass of that Petri sherry just before dinner. You know, that's the time you're a little on edge, you've just finished your day's work, and you're waiting for your dinner, and-- Well, that's when you want to lean back and take it easy. And, boy, that's the time a glass of Petri sherry tastes like something just too good to be true. Try it. Petri sherry's the perfect before-dinner wine. And, incidentally, if you like your sherry dry -- you
know, not sweet? -- then you'll find that Petri pale dry sherry is just made for you. The important thing is the Petri label, because when it says "Petri," it always means good wine.

MUSIC: THEME ... THEN OUT

ANNOUNCER: And now for our weekly visit with our good friend and host, Dr. Watson. Good evening, doctor.

WATSON: Good evening, Mr. Bartell. You're a bit late. I've been keeping some dinner hot for you here. Pull up your chair and join me.

ANNOUNCER: That's very nice of you. Thanks, doctor. Are you all set with tonight's story?

WATSON: Yes, my boy. I'm "all set" as you call it. As a matter of fact, I was going over my notes on the case just before you arrived.

ANNOUNCER: Last week, you hinted that a beautiful girl figured prominently in your adventure.

WATSON: That's quite right, Mr. Bartell. An extremely beautiful girl. In fact, I often used to say to Sherlock Holmes that if I'd been a little younger at the time, I might-- Oh, well, you haven't come here to listen to my personal reminiscences. You want to hear the story that I called "The Problem of Thor Bridge."

ANNOUNCER: That's what you promised us, doctor. How did it begin?

WATSON: (NARRATES) On a windy morning in October -- in 1890, it was -- as I was dressing, I observed how the last remaining leaves were being whirled away from the solitary plane tree which graced the yard behind our Baker Street house. I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. But, to my surprise, he was in an unusually gay mood. As I entered the room, he looked up at me and, with a smile, he spoke.

HOLMES: (CHEERY) Good morning, my dear fellow. I hope you slept well.

WATSON: Splendidly, thanks, Holmes.

HOLMES: I'm so glad.

WATSON: Well, you're very solicitous this morning. I - I think you must have got a new case. (CHUCKLES) Am I right?

HOLMES: The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious. Yes, I have a new case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation, the wheels revolve once more.

WATSON: Good. Tell me all about it.

HOLMES: Well, as yet, there isn't much to tell. Have you ever heard of Neil Gibson?

WATSON: Neil Gibson? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Something to do with gold mining, hasn't he?

HOLMES: A great deal to do with it, my dear fellow. In fact, he's considered the greatest mining magnate in the world. About five years ago, he bought a large estate in Hampshire. Perhaps you've read of the tragic death of his wife.

WATSON: Oh, yes, of course. I remember the case now. She was murdered by a jealous governess who was in her employ, wasn't she?

HOLMES: That point will be decided when the lady in question -- Grace Dunbar, I believe her name is -- comes up for trial at the forthcoming Winchester Assizes. In any case, it's hard to see what I can do for my client at this late date.

WATSON: Your client?

HOLMES: Oh, yes. I forgot I hadn't told you. I'm getting into your involved habit of telling a story backwards. You'd better read this letter; came this morning.

SOUND: RATTLE OF PAPER

WATSON: Let's have a look. (READS) "Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Miss Dunbar is innocent. I can't see the finest woman in the world go to her death without doing everything possible to save her. I shall call on you at ten-thirty to-morrow morning to discuss the matter. Yours faithfully, Neil Gibson." Good gracious me.

HOLMES: There you have it, Watson. That is the gentleman I await. 

WATSON: Do you know anything about his dead wife?

HOLMES: Only what I've been reading in the papers. Apparently, she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as this Miss Dunbar, who superintended the education of the two young children, is reputed to be a very attractive young lady.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) The eternal triangle, eh? Well, where did the murder take place?

HOLMES: On Gibson's estate in Hampshire. His wife was found on the grounds nearly half a mile from the manor house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and -- a revolver bullet through her brain. 

WATSON: Any weapon found near her?

HOLMES: No, there were no clues found at the scene of the crime.

WATSON: What made them suspect the governess?

HOLMES: Well, in the first place, there was some very incriminating evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber -- the calibre corresponding with the bullet in the dead woman's head -- was found on the floor in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe.

WATSON: Oh, was it? Pretty damaging evidence, Holmes.

HOLMES: Mmm. So the coroner thought. And, to make the case even blacker against Miss Dunbar, the dead woman had a note on her making an appointment at that very spot -- and the note was signed by the governess.

WATSON: It seems obvious that the girl's guilty. And the motive's clear. Mr. Gibson would be a great catch for a young girl. Love, fortune, power -- all dependent on one life. 

HOLMES: Possibly, Watson, but circumstantial evidence can be very misleading at times.

SOUND: DOOR BELL JANGLES

HOLMES: Ah, there's the gentleman in question, unless I'm very much mistaken, considerably before his time.

WATSON: (OFF) Well, I can see him from the window here. Formidable-looking fellow. Must be well over six foot tall.

SOUND: DOOR BELL JANGLES, LOUDER

HOLMES: (LAUGHS) Judging by the way he's wrenching at that door bell, he's a man with a violent temper.

WATSON: (OFF) Mrs. Hudson's opening the door to him now.

HOLMES: Ah, meet him on the stairs, will you, old chap? It'll save Mrs. Hudson a journey.

WATSON: (OFF) Right you are, Holmes.

SOUND: WATSON'S FOOTSTEPS TO DOOR ... DOOR OPENS

WATSON: (OFF, CALLS) Up here, sir!

GIBSON: (OFF, TO WATSON) Are you Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

WATSON: (OFF) No, no, indeed. I'm his colleague Dr. Watson. Come along in, won't you?

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES ... FOOTSTEPS IN

HOLMES: Mr. Neil Gibson, I presume?

GIBSON: That's right. So you're the great Sherlock Holmes, huh?

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) The adjective is your own, Mr. Gibson. Sit down, won't you? By the way, you may speak quite freely in front of Dr. Watson.

GIBSON: Hm. Well, I may as well begin by telling you that money means nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it's any use to you in lighting the truth. Miss Dunbar is innocent and it's up to you to prove it. Just name your fee.

HOLMES: Mr. Gibson, my professional charges are on a fixed scale. I don't vary them, except when I omit them altogether.

GIBSON: Very well. I imagine that you read the newspaper reports of the coroner's inquest.

HOLMES: Yes, very thoroughly.

GIBSON: I don't see that I can add anything that'll help you. But if there are any questions you'd like to ask, I'll answer them.

HOLMES: Well, thank you. First, what were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?

GIBSON: (TENSE) I suppose you're within your rights in asking such a question, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) We will agree to suppose so, shall we?

GIBSON: (UNCONVINCINGLY) Then I can assure you that my relations with Miss Dunbar were always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, except in the company of his children.

HOLMES: (DISGUSTED) Ohh. (DISMISSIVE) I'm rather a busy man, Mr. Gibson, and I've no time or taste for aimless conversation. I wish you good-morning.

GIBSON: (ANGRY) What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? 

HOLMES: My dear sir, the case is difficult enough without your giving me false information.

GIBSON: Meaning that I lie, sir?

HOLMES: I was trying to express it as delicately as possible, but - (CLEARS THROAT) - if you insist on the word I won't contradict you.

GIBSON: Why, you confounded--!

HOLMES: Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson. Please, don't be noisy. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.

GIBSON: I suppose I can't make you take the case - but you've done yourself no good this morning, Mr. Holmes! (MOVING OFF) I've broken stronger men than you! No man ever crossed me and was the better for it!

SOUND: GIBSON'S FOOTSTEPS TO DOOR WHICH OPENS

HOLMES: (CALLS) Good-morning, Mr. Gibson. You've a great deal yet to learn.

SOUND: DOOR SLAMS SHUT

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) Upon my soul, Holmes, you were unusually severe with him. (CHUCKLES) 

HOLMES: (STERN) I dislike liars, Watson, and I cannot tolerate arrogance -- particularly when it's coupled with great wealth.

WATSON: How did you know about his relations with the governess?

HOLMES: I didn't. It was pure bluff.

WATSON: Bluff! (CHUCKLES) Well, it certainly worked. Think he'll come back?

HOLMES: Oh, of course he will. He needs my help too badly. He'll probably change his mind before he's halfway down the stairs.

SOUND: SIMULTANEOUS KNOCK AT DOOR

HOLMES: (CALLS) Come in! 

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

HOLMES: Ah! (CHUCKLES) Mr. Gibson. Just saying to Dr. Watson that I was certain you'd be back.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES ... GIBSON'S FOOTSTEPS IN

GIBSON: (APPROACHES) I've been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that perhaps I was hasty in taking your remarks amiss. Just the same, I can assure you that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me really don't affect this case.

HOLMES: Surely, that is for me to decide, Mr. Gibson.

WATSON: You see, Mr. Gibson, my friend is like a doctor. He wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.

GIBSON: Fire away, Mr. Holmes. What is it you want to know?

HOLMES: The truth.

GIBSON: I can give it to you in a very few words. To begin with, I met my wife when I was gold-mining in Brazil. 

WATSON: Your wife was Brazilian by birth, wasn't she, sir?

GIBSON: Yes, doctor, and very beautiful. Well, to make a long story short, I fell in love and married her and brought her to England. After a few years, I realized that we had nothing -- absolutely nothing -- in common. 

HOLMES: And then, I suppose, this young governess, Miss Dunbar, arrived on the scene.

GIBSON: That's right, Mr. Holmes. Well, the story should be obvious to you from there.

WATSON: You fell in love with this girl, I suppose, sir.

GIBSON: Who could help it?

HOLMES: Did you suggest marriage to her?

GIBSON: Yes. Though I knew that my wife would never divorce me.

HOLMES: I see. Then you made an utterly insincere proposition to her.

GIBSON: Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, I came to you on a question of evidence, not of morals. I'm not asking for your criticism.

HOLMES: It's only the young lady's sake that forces me to touch your case at all. Now, tell me, sir. What is your own opinion as to Miss Dunbar's guilt?

GIBSON: It's very black against her, I can't deny that. One explanation of the tragedy did come into my head, Mr. Holmes. I give it to you, for what it's worth. 

HOLMES: Pray continue, Mr. Gibson.

GIBSON: My wife was bitterly jealous. She was half-crazy with hatred. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar -- or, we'll say, to threaten the girl with a revolver and so frighten her into leaving us. There might have been a struggle in which the gun exploded and gone off and shot my wife who was holding it.

HOLMES: Well, that possibility has already occurred to me. It's the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.

WATSON: The revolver, Holmes. It was found on the floor of the governess' wardrobe.

HOLMES: Mr. Gibson, I should like to examine your house and the scene of the murder as soon as possible.

GIBSON: Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Sergeant Coventry of the local police is still down there. He'll give you any help you may need.

HOLMES: Excellent! Watson, old fellow -- [?] the timetable! We're catching the next fast train to Winchester!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: PASTORAL AMBIANCE -- BIRDS WHISTLE, AN OCCASIONAL DOG BARKS 

SERGEANT: So if I have to have someone else on the case, I'd rather have you, Mr. 'Olmes. The Yard gets called in, then we local police loses all credit for success; generally gets blamed for the failures. Now, I've heard that you play straight.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) I need not appear in the matter at all, Sergeant Coventry. If I can clear it up, I don't ask to even have my name mentioned.

SERGEANT: Well, that's handsome of you, I'm sure now. I know your friend, Dr. Watson, can be trusted, too. 

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) Don't worry, my dear fellow. We won't steal any of your thunder.

SERGEANT: Oh, that's nice and friendly of you, doctor. Well, come on, gentlemen, I'll walk you down to the bridge. That's where we found Mrs. Gibson's body. It's not far from the 'ouse 'ere.

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS TRUDGE ON TRAIL

WATSON: Well, I must say, Mr. Gibson has a beautiful estate. It must be sixty or seventy acres.

SERGEANT: Oh, nearly twice that, doctor. The woods back o' the house there belongs to him, too. (BEAT) Mr. 'Olmes?

HOLMES: Yes, sergeant?

SERGEANT: There's a question I'd like to ask you. A question I wouldn't ask anyone else.

HOLMES: Then please ask it.

SERGEANT: Don't you think there might be a case against Mr. Gibson hisself, sir?

HOLMES: I've been considering that possibility.

SERGEANT: That there Miss Dunbar's a bit of all right. If y'ask me, he wanted his wife out of the way. And the pistol she was shot with was his pistol, you know.

WATSON: Oh? Was that fact proven?

SERGEANT: Yes, doctor. It was one of a pair that he had.

HOLMES: One of a pair? Where's the other?

SERGEANT: Well, Mr. Gibson has a lot of firearms. We never quite matched that particular pistol -- but the box was made for two.

WATSON: Well, if it was one of a pair, surely you'd be able to match it.

SERGEANT: Well, we 'ave 'em all laid out at the house if you want to look 'em over.

HOLMES: We'll do that later. 

SOUND: WATER RUNS UNDER BRIDGE ... CONTINUES IN BG

HOLMES: Ah! This, I presume, is Thor Bridge.

SERGEANT: That's right, sir. Found Mrs. Gibson's body lying right here at the approach to the bridge. 

HOLMES: I see. I gathered from the newspaper reports that the shot was fired at very close quarters.

SERGEANT: Yes, sir, very close.

HOLMES: Near the right temple, wasn't it?

SERGEANT: Just behind it, sir.

WATSON: How did the body lie, sergeant?

SERGEANT: Oh, on its back, doctor. No trace of a struggle. No marks. No weapon. The note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.

HOLMES: Clutched, you say?

SERGEANT: Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers to get at it.

HOLMES: Ah, that's of greatest importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. 

WATSON: What did the note say, sergeant?

SERGEANT: Little enough, doctor. It just said, uh, "I will be at Thor Bridge at nine o'clock" and it was signed "Grace Dunbar."

HOLMES: Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?

SERGEANT: Oh, yes, sir.

HOLMES: What was her explanation?

SERGEANT: She wouldn't say nothing. Said she was saving her defence for the trial.

HOLMES: Yes, it seems odd that Mrs. Gibson was still clutching that note.

WATSON: Seems perfectly natural to me.

HOLMES: Oh, come now, old fellow, argue the thing out logically. If the letter is genuine, it was certainly received some time before the tragedy -- say an hour or two. Why, then, was the dead woman still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she carry it so carefully? She certainly didn't need to refer to the note at all at the interview. Doesn't it strike you as rather strange?

WATSON: Well, now, you put it that way, it does seem a little peculiar.

HOLMES: Hello!

SOUND: HOLMES' FOOTSTEPS AWAY VIA THE BRIDGE

HOLMES: (OFF) Did you notice this, sergeant?

SERGEANT: Oh, you mean that chip out of that stone on the underside of the parapet of the bridge, sir? Yes, I noticed it. Didn't think nothin' of it, though. 

WATSON: (OFF) Not a very large chip.

HOLMES: (OFF) Yes, but it's been done recently. Notice how the stonework is white just here. It took some violence to do that. Hand me your cane, Watson, will you?

WATSON: (OFF) Here you are.

HOLMES: (OFF) Thanks.

SOUND: HOLMES RAPIDLY WHACKS STONE WITH WOODEN CANE HALF A DOZEN TIMES

HOLMES: (OFF) Yes, it was a hard knock. (CLOSER) And in a curious place, too.

SERGEANT: But it's fifteen feet from where we found the body, Mr. 'Olmes.

WATSON: Yes, Holmes, I don't see how it could have any connection with Mrs. Gibson's murder.

HOLMES: Well, perhaps it hasn't. But it's a point worth noting. There were no footprints, you say, sergeant?

SERGEANT: None, Mr. 'Olmes. The ground was as hard as iron. It's been a very dry summer and we haven't had any rain to speak of.

HOLMES: That's a pity. Hmm. Well, sergeant, I'm much obliged to you and now I think we'll go back to the house.

SERGEANT: Right. Cesar'll show you where the firearms are, sir.

HOLMES: Oh, uh, who is Cesar?

SERGEANT: Oh, a funny kind of a bloke. Brazilian, I guess.

HOLMES: Brazilian, eh? Like Mrs. Gibson?

SERGEANT: Yes, Mr. 'Olmes. Comes from the same town as she does, as a matter of fact. Something very fishy about 'im, if you ask me. Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm going to take a little stroll around the grounds. You've started me on a new train of thought in this case, Mr. 'Olmes.

HOLMES: (LAUGHS) I'm delighted, sergeant. [Come, Watson, let's] get back to the house.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

HOLMES: I see. And these are all the firearms in Mr. Gibson's possession, eh, Cesar?

CESAR: Mm. Except for the revolver that is missing from the case. [?]

WATSON: I've never seen such a collection of guns and revolvers in my life.

CESAR: Mr. Gibson have many enemies, señor. He always sleep with a loaded pistol beside his bed. He is a man of great violence. There have been times when all of us were afraid of him. 

HOLMES: Did you ever witness physical violence towards Mrs. Gibson?

CESAR: No, señor, I cannot say that I have. But I have heard him say many terrible things to her. He would taunt her in front of we servants. I have heard him do it many times.

HOLMES: Thank you, Cesar, that will be all.

CESAR: Muy bueno, señor.

SOUND: CESAR'S FOOTSTEPS AWAY

WATSON: You know, Holmes, I still think the case against Miss Dunbar looks very black.

HOLMES: I should agree with you if it were not for one fact -- the finding of the revolver in her wardrobe.

WATSON: (TAKEN ABACK) Upon my soul, Holmes. That seems to me the strongest evidence of all.

HOLMES: I think not, old chap.

WATSON: Huh?

HOLMES: We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it, we must suspect deception.

WATSON: I don't quite follow you.

HOLMES: Suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in cold, premeditated fashion, is about to murder a rival. You've planned it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have a weapon. The crime is well done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you mean to tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you'd be so stupid as to forget to fling the incriminating revolver to the bottom of the stream? Or perhaps in the dense reeds that border it? Would you carefully carry it home and put it in the first place that would be searched? Your wardrobe?

WATSON: Well, perhaps in the excitement of the moment--

HOLMES: No, no, my dear chap, I won't admit that's even possible. When a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. 

WATSON: Well then, if Miss Dunbar didn't shoot Mrs. Gibson, who the devil did?

HOLMES: I hope I can give you the answer to that question, Watson, when we've made one further visit.

WATSON: (WEARILY) Oh, Lord. Where are we going now?

HOLMES: To prison, old chap.

WATSON: Prison?

HOLMES: Yes, we're going to Winchester Prison to call on Miss Dunbar. I'm certain that the key to this strange mystery lies in her hands.

MUSIC: TO A FINISH

ANNOUNCER: You'll hear the rest of Dr. Watson's story in just a few seconds. Just time enough for me to remind you that the easiest way to make good food taste better is to serve that good food with a good Petri Wine. If you like a red wine, well, you want a Petri California burgundy. If you'd rather have a white wine, then you want a Petri California sauterne. But, red or white, Petri burgundy or Petri sauterne, you're choosing a dinner wine that's sure to turn a simple meal into a feast. Your whole family and all your friends will love Petri, the wine that makes good food taste better. 

MUSIC: THEME FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN IN BG, OUT AT [X]

ANNOUNCER: And now back to Dr. Watson and tonight's Sherlock Holmes adventure, "The Problem of Thor Bridge." [X] Well, uh, doctor, did you go to Winchester Prison and see Miss Dunbar?

WATSON: We did, Mr. Bartell. An hour later found the two of us sitting in a dank and gloomy cell talking to one of the most beautiful girls that I've ever seen. Her bright, flashing eyes and her air of quiet confidence seemed sadly out of place in such a setting. Holmes spoke to her, quietly soothing her.

HOLMES: Miss Dunbar, tell us of your true relations with the dead woman.

DUNBAR: She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with all the passion of her distorted mind.

HOLMES: Please tell us exactly what happened on the evening of Mrs. Gibson's death.

DUNBAR: Well, I - I received a note from her in the morning, a note imploring me to meet her at the bridge after dinner that night. She said she had something important to say to me.

WATSON: Did you keep that note, Miss Dunbar?

DUNBAR: No, doctor. She-- Well, she asked me to destroy the note, so I burned it in the schoolroom grate. I saw no reason for such secrecy but-- Well, I - I did as she asked.

HOLMES: Hmm. And yet she kept your reply very carefully. That's interesting. Tell me what happened when you met her that night.

DUNBAR: When I reached the bridge, she was waiting for me. I - I won't tell you what she said. But she poured out her whole, wild fury in burning, horrible words. I did not [even answer] -- I couldn't. It was dreadful even to look at her. She was like an insane woman, standing there screaming disgusting insults at me. I - I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. 

WATSON: Where was she standing when you left her? 

DUNBAR: Within a few yards of the spot where her body was found later.

HOLMES: And yet, presuming she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?

DUNBAR: No. No, I heard nothing. But I was so upset, Mr. Holmes, that I rushed straight back to my room.

HOLMES: Did you leave it again that night?

DUNBAR: Yes. When the alarm came that Mrs. Gibson was dead, I ran out with the others.

WATSON: Did you see Mr. Gibson?

DUNBAR: Yes, doctor. He had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.

HOLMES: This pistol that [was] found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?

DUNBAR: Never, Mr. Holmes, I swear it.

WATSON: When was it found, Miss Dunbar?

DUNBAR: Next morning, when the police made their search. It was on the floor of my wardrobe where I keep my shoes.

HOLMES: Hm. You've no idea how long it had been there?

DUNBAR: Well, it hadn't been there the morning before.

HOLMES: How do you know?

DUNBAR: Because I tidied up the wardrobe that day.

HOLMES: I see. Then someone must have come into your room and placed the pistol there in order to incriminate you.

DUNBAR: I'm certain of it.

WATSON: Well, when - when could they have done that?

DUNBAR: Well, it - it could have been at meal-time, or when I was in the schoolroom with the children.

HOLMES: Yes. Miss Dunbar, on examining the scene of Mrs. Gibson's death, I noticed that a piece of stonework on the underside of the parapet of the bridge had been broken away. Can you suggest any possible explanation for that?

DUNBAR: Oh, surely, it must have been a mere coincidence, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Possibly. But why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and at the very place? Could it possibly be that--? (THUNDERSTRUCK) Why, yes, of course! Idiot! Why didn't I think of it before?! Come along, Watson!

WATSON: Where are we going, Holmes?

HOLMES: Back to Thor Bridge, old fellow, as fast as we can get there!

DUNBAR: What have you found out, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: The answer to this mystery I hope, my dear young lady. You will get news before the day is out. And meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that the light of truth is breaking through!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: RUNNING WATER UNDER BRIDGE ... CONTINUES IN BG

SERGEANT: Well, Mr. 'Olmes, you're soon back here. What have you found out?

HOLMES: Tell you in a few moments. You got my message?

SERGEANT: Yes, here you are, a ball of twine. What you want it for, I can't imagine.

HOLMES: You'll soon see, sergeant. Uh, Watson, I, uh, have some recollection that you usually go armed on these excursions of ours.

WATSON: Yes, I'm carrying my revolver. Why?

HOLMES: Give it to me, old chap, will you? Thanks. I believe your revolver may have a very intimate connection with the mystery we're investigating.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) You're joking.

HOLMES: No, Watson, I'm very serious. We have a test to make. If the test is successful, Miss Dunbar will be free before nightfall. And the test will depend on the conduct of this revolver of yours. 

SOUND: HOLMES UNLOADS BULLETS FROM REVOLVER

HOLMES: I take the precaution of unloading it. Uh huh. There we are. Now, sergeant, ball of twine, please.

SERGEANT: Wish I knew what you was up to, sir.

HOLMES: I tie one end of the twine -- like this -- to the handle of the revolver. So. Sergeant, see if you can find me a heavy stone, will you?

SERGEANT: Right you are, sir.

WATSON: Holmes, what are you doing?

HOLMES: Trying to reconstruct the killing of Mrs. Gibson. But you've seen me miss the mark before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when it first flashed across my mind in Miss Dunbar's cell, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet-- Oh, well. We can but try.

SERGEANT: Here's a nice stone, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Thank you, sergeant! Now! I tie the other end of this twine to a stone. Wait a minute. Like that. Splendid! Uh, sergeant, will you please take this stone and stretch the twine across the parapet of the bridge there -- so that the stone will swing just clear of the water on the other side of the bridge?

SERGEANT: Right you are, sir.

HOLMES: I'll stand on the spot where Mrs. Gibson's body was found. (CALLS) That's it, sergeant. Over the parapet.

SERGEANT: (OFF) All set, Mr. Holmes. The stone's swinging about eight feet above the water.

HOLMES: Splendid! Now, Watson, watch closely. I raise the revolver to my head.

WATSON: Careful, Holmes, careful.

HOLMES: Don't worry, old chap, it's not loaded. Now, let us imagine I am the late Mrs. Gibson. I raise the revolver to my head and fire it.

SOUND: CLICK OF EMPTY REVOLVER

HOLMES: Instantly, my fingers release their grip and--

SOUND: GUN RATTLES ACROSS BRIDGE ... LOUD CLANG AS METAL GUN HITS STONE PARAPET ... SPLASHES AS STONE AND GUN SINK INTO STREAM

HOLMES: There's your answer, Watson!

WATSON: Great Scott! The revolver flashed back out of your hand -- struck the parapet of the bridge -- and then the weight of the stone flipped it over into the water!

HOLMES: Was there ever a more exact demonstration? Come on, old fellow!

SERGEANT: You're a bloomin' magician, Mr. 'Olmes! That's what you are, a bloomin' magician!

HOLMES: Look at that! There's the second chip on the stonework of the parapet here -- same size as the first! 

WATSON: Then the murder of Mrs. Gibson--?

HOLMES: Wasn't murder at all! It was suicide!

WATSON: What?

HOLMES: We can follow the various steps quite clearly. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar. A note which made it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. Mrs. Gibson, in her anxiety that the note should be discovered, somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. That alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.

WATSON: Then she stole one of her husband's revolvers--! 

SERGEANT: And planted the other one in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe!

HOLMES: Exactly! After discharging one of the cartridges, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting suspicion, she then went down to the bridge where she contrived this exceedingly ingenious method of getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared, she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when the girl had left, carried out her terrible purpose. 

SERGEANT: Then the missing revolver--?

HOLMES: You'll find it, with the aid of a grappling hook, at the bottom of the stream, and also the stone and the string, with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and fasten a charge of murder on an innocent victim. 

WATSON: Yes, sergeant, and don't forget, while you're at it, that my revolver's down there, too.

SERGEANT: (MOVING OFF) Oh, don't worry, doctor. I'll get some grappling hooks right away.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) I must say, Holmes, you've solved this case brilliantly. Quite brilliantly.

HOLMES: Ah, I disagree, old chap. And I fear that you will not improve my reputation by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. 

WATSON: Oh, nonsense. But that's ridiculous.

HOLMES: Oh, no, it isn't, old boy. I've been sluggish in my mind -- and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the very basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.

WATSON: Well, Holmes, personally, I agree with the sergeant's opinion of you.

HOLMES: Oh? What was that, old fellow?

WATSON: (MIMICS THE SERGEANT) You're a bloomin' magician, Mr. 'Olmes! That's what you are, a bloomin' magician! (LAUGHS)

MUSIC: TO A FINISH

ANNOUNCER: Well, doctor, Holmes really was a magician -- that is, if you did find Mrs. Gibson's revolver, and your own, in the stream.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) Oh, we found them all right. You don't think I'd tell you the story otherwise, do you? What do you take me for, anyway?

ANNOUNCER: Well, now that you ask, I'll tell you. I take you for a very charming gentleman, a wonderful storyteller, and a fine host.

WATSON: (BURBLES IN EMBARRASSMENT) Oh, really, I--

ANNOUNCER: Well, you are a gentleman, of the old school.

WATSON: (MORE BURBLING)

ANNOUNCER: And you do tell a fine story.

WATSON: You flatter me. You--

ANNOUNCER: And you are a perfect host. That meal we had tonight was wonderful.

WATSON: Oh, it was?

ANNOUNCER: And, um, that - that wine. What kind was it?

WATSON: (STOPS BURBLING, REPROVING) It was Petri Wine, and you know it.

ANNOUNCER: (CHUCKLES)

WATSON: And I should have known you were leading up to something. Mr. Bartell, you should be ashamed of yourself. You'll do anything to get a chance to talk about Petri Wine. Though I can't say that I blame you.

ANNOUNCER: Oh, honestly, doctor, I meant everything I said. But you don't really want me to stop talking about Petri Wine, do you? After all, it's worth talking about, isn't it? What other wine is made with the loving care that goes into Petri Wine? Don't forget, Petri Wine is made by the Petri Family. Winemaking is their business. Why, they've been making wine for generations, handing down -- from father to son, from father to son -- all their skill and knowledge and experience. You can be sure the Petri Family really knows plenty about the fine art of turning luscious grapes into delicious wine. That's why, whether you want a wine for before dinner, with dinner, or for any time, you can't go wrong with a Petri Wine. "Because Petri took time / to bring you good wine." And now, Dr. Watson, what new story are you planning to tell us next week?

WATSON: Well, next week, Mr. Bartell, I'm going to tell an adventure that Holmes and I had amid the Oriental magnificence of a maharaja's palace in India.

ANNOUNCER: India? Sounds intriguing. What were you and Sherlock Holmes doing out there, doctor?

WATSON: Oh, well, you'll have to wait till next week for the answer to that question, my boy. But I can tell you that it was one of the weirdest problems that we ever had to solve. I call the story, "The Vanishing Elephant."

ANNOUNCER: The Petri Family -- the Family that Took Time / to Bring you Good Wine -- invites you to listen to Dr. Watson tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective, Sherlock Holmes. 

And, as for me, well, I'd like to tell ya that a time like right now is the perfect time for a glass of Petri California port. After you've had a good dinner, boy, Petri port is a real topper! That rich, deep red Petri port is really an extraordinary wine. Even its color's different. And, as for its flavor, well, it'll take a better man than me to describe that. Petri port is a hearty wine, sure. And every other quality that you look for in a good port, you'll find in Petri port, and then some. Try Petri port by itself or serve it with fruit, with nuts, or with cake. But share it with your friends, will ya? Because you can serve it proudly. After all, it is a Petri wine -- and that name Petri is the proudest name in the history of American wines.

MUSIC: THEME ... FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

ANNOUNCER: And now let's visit our old friend and host, Dr. Watson.

WATSON: Good evening, Mr. Bartell.

ANNOUNCER: Good evening, Doctor.

WATSON: Settle yourself down and get your pipe going.

ANNOUNCER: Thanks. Doctor, last week you told us that tonight's story took place in the Casbah, at Algiers.

WATSON: Yes, the Casbah. I remember it as the place of countless streets winding up and down, past colorful cafés where a hundred tongues were spoken, and often a street would end in shadowy darkness which a man would be foolhardy to enter alone. Yes, Mr. Bartell, that was the Casbah that Sherlock Holmes and I knew in that winter of Ninety-Nine.

ANNOUNCER: Well, how did you happen to be out there, Doctor?

WATSON: Do you mind if I tell you the story from the start, Mr. Bartell? It really began on a wintry night in Baker Street at the conclusion of the strange murder in Montrevor Castle. A charming young girl sat on the sofa of our lodgings in Baker Street and talked to us. (FADES OUT) 

SOUND: TRANSITIONAL PAUSE

TETFIELD: (FADES IN) But, Mr. Holmes, you can't say you'll have nothing more to do with the Montrevors--

HOLMES: My dear Miss Tetfield, I found the true murderer of the Dowager Countess and he committed suicide. Surely the case has ended.

TETFIELD: Yes, Mr. Holmes, you found the real murderer. But now I want you to find the unfortunate young man who fled England five years ago when he was suspected of the crime.

WATSON: This is a new development, Miss Tetfield. Please tell us about it.

TETFIELD: It's Douglas Milton that I'm talking about.

HOLMES: Oh, yes, yes, yes. He was the heir to the title, wasn't he?

TETFIELD: Yes, Mr. Holmes. He was a sensitive, artistic boy and - and when he knew that he was under suspicion, he ran away.

HOLMES: Mm hm.

TETFIELD: Of course, everyone regarded his flight as an admission of guilt. That is, until you found the real culprit, Mr. Holmes.

WATSON: I imagine, Miss Tetfield, that your interest in the missing boy is not entirely, shall we say, altruistic?

TETFIELD: I'm in love with him, Dr. Watson.

WATSON: Oh.

TETFIELD: We were engaged to be married when he ran away. Mr. Holmes, you've got to find him. He must know that his name has been cleared and that he's inherited the title. 

HOLMES: Miss Tetfield, have you any direct news, any letter, from your fiancé since he left five years ago? 

TETFIELD: None.

HOLMES: Any clues as to his hiding place?

TETFIELD: Only this. 

SFX: PACKAGE UNWRAPPED

TETFIELD: It's a painting I received anonymously a year after he had left.

HOLMES: Oh.

TETFIELD: It was sent from a forwarding address in London. Here it is, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Thank you.

WATSON: (IMPRESSED) A small oil painting. Very good one, too, I'd say.

HOLMES: Yes. It's a splendid sense of composition and his use of color is unusually brilliant. Do you recognize this painting as the work of your fiancé, Miss Tetfield?

TETFIELD: I'm certain of it.

HOLMES: Yes. Wonderful use of color. Observe the delicate shadings of that sunset, and the brilliant green of the oasis. This scene is extraordinarily reminiscent of the desert in North Africa. 

TETFIELD: Yes. Yes, that's what made me say I was certain he'd gone abroad, Mr. Holmes.

WATSON: But why should he go to North Africa?

HOLMES: A good place, Watson, for an Englishman who imagines himself to be escaping justice. Remember, the Foreign Legion is stationed there.

TETFIELD: Do you think he might have joined the Legion, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: It would seem logical. No questions are asked of those who join it and its colorful obscurity might easily appeal to a young fellow in trouble. Hello!

WATSON: What is it, Holmes?

HOLMES: There are quite a few grains of sand in-between the canvas and the frame here. Miss Tetfield, do you mind if I pry the canvas loose?

TETFIELD: Do anything you like, Mr. Holmes, if it gives you any clue to Douglas' whereabouts.

HOLMES: Give me your pen knife, will you, Watson?

WATSON: (GRUNTS) Here you are.

HOLMES: Thanks, old chap. 

SFX: CUTS CANVAS FROM FRAME BEHIND--

HOLMES: Wait a minute. Here we are. 

WATSON: Can you see anything?

HOLMES: Uh huh. Look! The words "Sheriff" and "El Affroun" are stamped here. Sheriff is probably the framer's name and El Affroun is a town some fifty miles from Algiers. (DECISIVE) That settles it. Miss Tetfield, I accept your case. Watson and I will go to Africa and try to find your fiancé, Douglas Milton.

MUSIC: ORGAN ... BRIDGE ... FADES OUT FOR BRIEF FOREIGN LEGION BUGLE CALL

SFX: BUZZ OF LEGIONNAIRES ... IN BG

COLONEL: (WARM GREETING) Monsieur Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I have heard of you so often, but I never thought I should see you here at the headquarters of the Foreign Legion. What can I do for you, gentlemen?

HOLMES: Well, Colonel De Brisson, I am trying to trace an Englishman who has been missing during the past four years. I've reason to believe that he might have joined the Legion.

COLONEL: Ah, I shall look in my records. 

SFX: BUZZ OF LEGIONNAIRES FADES OUT AS COLONEL WALKS TO RECORDS, PULLS THEM FROM SHELF AND LEAFS THROUGH THEM DURING FOLLOWING--

COLONEL: Let me see. Four years ago would be Eighteen Ninety-Five. If Sherlock Holmes is tracking him, then I suppose he was in trouble in his own country. If he was in trouble, he might easily have come to us. We ask no questions. Ninety-seven, ninety-six-- Ah! Ninety-five! (BEAT) In that year, three young Englishmen joined us. One of them died of dysentery two years ago in Sidi Rached. One of them deserted eighteen months ago and we have been unable to trace him. The third is my adjutant who brought you into my office just now.

HOLMES: And he is, I would say, about three inches shorter than Douglas Milton -- and men do not shrink in the Foreign Legion, eh, Colonel?

COLONEL: (AMUSED) They do not, Monsieur Holmes.

WATSON: Then the fellow who deserted must be our man.

HOLMES: Unless it's the one who died of dysentery. Colonel De Brisson, how would you advise us to set about trying to find a deserter?

COLONEL: Monsieur Holmes, there's only one place in Algeria where a man can hide from the Foreign Legion and remain hidden.

HOLMES: Oh? And what's that place?

COLONEL: The Casbah, in Algiers.

HOLMES: Then that's our destination, Watson. 

COLONEL: Be very careful, please, gentlemen. The Casbah is a place where the law is exiled. The police have no jurisdiction there. The only rule is that of strength, violence and trickery.

HOLMES: We shall be very cautious, I assure you. Goodbye, Colonel De Brisson, and thank you for your help.

MUSIC: ORGAN ... BRIDGE ... FADES OUT FOR AN EASTERN MELODY ON A FLUTE-LIKE INSTRUMENT AND--

SFX: BUZZ OF CASBAH CAFE CROWD ... IN BG

WATSON: Well, I must say that I think Colonel De Brisson rather exaggerated the dangers of the Casbah. Heh! I suppose you're going to tell me this café is the headquarters for a dope-smuggling ring or white slaving or something.

HOLMES: It's ramifications are even more extensive than those you've mentioned. 

WATSON: You're joking, Holmes.

HOLMES: I assure you, I'm not, old fellow. 

WATSON: What?

HOLMES: My old friend Duemmel is Chief of Police in Algiers. When I told him our mission, he advised me to come here. A five-hundred-franc note and the proprietor can obtain any and all information regarding the underworld. For as little as two hundred francs, he can arrange a murder. So that gives you some idea of the relative values in the Casbah.

WATSON: Good lord; then you've already spoken to the proprietor?

HOLMES: Oh, yes, yes, a charming scoundrelly fellow by the name of Rafi. I gave him five hundred francs and asked him to set his underworld grapevine in motion to see whether an Englishman living in hiding here in the Casbah could be found.

WATSON: And I thought we'd come here for a quiet meal. (CHUCKLES)

MUSIC: EASTERN MELODY OUT

HOLMES: Here comes Rafi now. Let's hope he has news for us. (CALLS) Here we are, Rafi! Come sit down, won't you?

RAFI: Ah, Rafi works fast, does he not, Mr. Holmes? Uh, your friend is--?

HOLMES: My friend knows that you're working with me. What have you found out?

RAFI: A drink first. The tongue of Rafi is parched. 

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES)

RAFI: Would you have me die of thirst before I give you my news? (CALLS, TO WAITER) Er, Vermouth Cassis!

WAITER: (OFF) Oui, M'sieu Rafi!

HOLMES: Uh, you have news for me, then?

RAFI: But yes. 

HOLMES: Good. What is it?

RAFI: First, you will pay me more money, no?

HOLMES: But I gave you five hundred francs. You said that you'd do the job for that.

RAFI: Can I help it if some tongues are more costly to make wag than others?

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES)

RAFI: It took the five hundred to get the wag. Am I to have nothing for my own trouble?

WAITER: Votre Vermouth Cassis, M'sieu Rafi!

RAFI: Ah, good, good. The gentleman will pay for it.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) 

SFX: COINS TOSSED ON TABLE

HOLMES: There you are.

WAITER: Merci, m'sieu!

RAFI: I will drink to your health, gentlemen. Both of you. (DRINKS, EXHALES) You will pay me more money, no?

WATSON: But my friend's already given you five hundred. You should stick to your bargain, my good fellow.

RAFI: My information is a bargain at seven hundred and fifty francs. It would be a bargain at a thousand, but Rafi will let you have it for seven hundred and fifty because he likes you.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) I see.

RAFI: You will give it to me, no?

HOLMES: And if I refuse?

RAFI: (CHUCKLES) Then you get no information. And, uh, perhaps I spread news in the Casbah that makes it uncomfortable for you gentlemen to be there.

WATSON: Great Scott, this is blackmail.

RAFI: I get the money, no?

HOLMES: (LAUGHS) You're a scoundrel, Rafi.

RAFI: Of course I am a scoundrel!

HOLMES: Here's your money. (LOW) The information?

RAFI: (LOW) There is an Englishman hiding here in the Casbah. I do not know his name, but he's tall and fair-haired. I cannot tell you where he lives, but if you go to the Café of a Thousand Sighs, you will find a girl who sings there -- a girl who sings like a nightingale. Her name is Ayisha and she can lead you to your Englishman.

HOLMES: A girl named Ayisha, in the Café of a Thousand Sighs?

RAFI: That is right. I would suggest that you go there in disguise. Two well-dressed Englishmen might find themselves in trouble. For a small fee -- say, two hundred francs -- I will escort you there myself.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Thank you, thank you, yes. I - I think we can manage by ourselves, Rafi.

RAFI: Oh, uh, if your business is concluded quickly and time weighs heavy on your hands, Rafi can take you to some places of rare interest -- dancing girls that wither one's eyeballs with their beauty! For five hundred francs, gentlemen--

HOLMES: Thank you, Rafi, thank you. I have a feeling that time will not weigh heavily on our hands. Good night.

RAFI: You work too hard, gentlemen. You should learn how to play. Good night.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) Upon my soul, I think that fellow's the biggest blackguard I ever met.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) I quite agree, old chap, but he is amusing. 

WATSON: Uh, by the way, Holmes -- don't you think that when this case is finished, we might have, er, time on our hands?

MUSIC: ANOTHER EASTERN MELODY ON A FLUTE-LIKE INSTRUMENT SNEAKS IN BEHIND--

HOLMES: (LAUGHS) Oh, ho ho! Watson, you're incorrigible. But I think-- (STOPS SHORT) Watson?

WATSON: What is it?

HOLMES: Look at the man sitting over in the corner by himself.

WATSON: By Jove, yes. His - his face seems familiar. We've seen him before somewhere.

HOLMES: Of course we have. His name is Oliver Leaming. We met him at the inquest on the Montrevor case. 

WATSON: So we did. Now, what on earth do you suppose he's doing here in the Casbah?

HOLMES: Not on a holiday, I'm sure. Mr. Oliver Leaming, if you recall, is a cousin of Douglas Milton's, the man we're searching for. If Milton were ever declared legally dead, Mr. Leaming over there would inherit the title. 

WATSON: It looks to me as if we're not the only people in the Casbah who are searching for the missing heir.

HOLMES: That's true, old fellow. Come on, let's go and talk to the gentleman.

SFX: HOLMES AND WATSON RISE FROM THEIR CHAIRS AND WALK OVER TO LEAMING ... CROWD NOISE AND FLUTE-LIKE INSTRUMENT FILL THE PAUSE

HOLMES: (CHEERFUL GREETING) Mr. Oliver Leaming! How very odd to meet you here!

HOLMES: Thank you.

SFX: HOLMES AND WATSON SIT

MUSIC: FADES GENTLY OUT DURING FOLLOWING--

LEAMING: World's a small place, isn't it? Or has somebody said that before? I wondered if you'd spot me over here in the corner.

WATSON: Oh, you saw us, then?

LEAMING: Of course! But you seemed to be in such deep conversation with that scoundrel Rafi, I didn't like to disturb you.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Very considerate of you, I'm sure. Why are you here, Mr. Leaming?

LEAMING: Oh --- I'm making a business trip. This is my day off.

HOLMES: As I recall it, you're in the publishing business.

LEAMING: Correct. What a memory you have, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) It seems peculiar that you should be on a business trip here. Are you planning on opening a publishing house in Algiers? Or are you searching the Casbah for new authors?

LEAMING: Why not? I'm a great believer in encouraging new talent.

HOLMES: (MORE SERIOUS) Mr. Leaming, why don't you admit that you're here for the express purpose of trying to find your cousin Douglas Milton?

LEAMING: (MOCKING) Mr. Holmes, you've discovered my secret. The great Sherlock Holmes and his watchdog have their eagle eyes on me. They know that I succeed to the title if Douglas Milton dies.

HOLMES: Yes, Mr. Leaming, we know that fact.

LEAMING: And you have fathomed my plan -- to find Douglas before [you] and kill him, so that I may inherit the title. How lucky I am to meet you in the Casbah where you cannot arrest me. Hm! (RISES) Well, it's a race against time, gentlemen. But I have a head start, as you will soon find out. (MOVING OFF) Goodbye, and the best of luck to you.

MUSIC: FLUTE-LIKE INSTRUMENT RESUMES BEHIND--

WATSON: Hm! What an extraordinary fellow. He's joking, of course.

HOLMES: I believe not, Watson. I think he labors under the whimsical belief that the best method of discounting the truth is to state it baldly so that it will not be believed.

WATSON: Great Scott, then we must work fast.

HOLMES: Yes, old chap, we must. I am sure that we're entrants in a race against death. We must get back to the hotel and into our disguises as quickly as possible. After that, we shall visit a young lady named Ayisha in the Café of a Thousand Sighs. And I am certain, Watson, that it will be the first time two men have ever entered the Casbah for the express purpose of preventing a murder!

MUSIC: ORGAN ... CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: We'll hear the rest of Dr. Watson's story in just about a second -- which gives me time to remind you that if you like the flavor of big plump juicy Muscat grapes, you'll love the flavor of Petri California Muscatel. What a wine! Petri Muscatel is the perfect after-dinner wine. It looks good; smells better than it looks; and when it comes to the taste department, well, you never tasted anything like it. For a really good wine, remember, first, Petri; then Muscatel -- Petri Muscatel.

Well, Doctor, I can hardly wait to hear what happened next. You and Sherlock Holmes went back to the hotel, I suppose.

WATSON: Yes, Mr. Bartell. Holmes quickly adopted the disguise of an Arab guide while I assumed the role of a tourist, and we started off on our search. Outside the Café of a Thousand Sighs, we met with a rude shock. (TO HOLMES) Good lord! It's the fellow we met in the café.

HOLMES: Yes, Oliver Leaming -- with a knife between his shoulders. 

WATSON: He's dead, Holmes. Shouldn't we get in touch with the police?

HOLMES: What can they do? Remember, there is no law in the Casbah. In any case, this man is beyond our help. Our job is to protect the living. Come on, old fellow, let's go to the Café of a Thousand Sighs and find this girl, Ayisha -- the girl Rafi says sings like a nightingale.

HOLMES: (ACCENT) I will see if it can be arranged, master. (LOW) Wait here for me, Watson. I'll see what I can do.

WATSON: (LOW) Right you are, Holmes. Be careful now.

HOLMES: (ACCENT) Mademoiselle Ayisha?

AYISHA: (HARSH) What do you want, greasy one?

HOLMES: (ACCENT) There is an Englishman at the table over there. He wishes to talk to Ayisha.

AYISHA: Which one is he?

HOLMES: (ACCENT) The man who sits at the table in the corner. He is very rich, Ayisha, and he admires you a great deal. He told me to give you this five-hundred-franc note.

SFX: RUSTLE OF MONEY CHANGING HANDS

AYISHA: So? Wery well. You may bring him to my rooms. The door is at top of stairway, to the right.

HOLMES: (ACCENT) Good, Ayisha. I fetch him.

WATSON: I hope you know how you're going to handle this, Holmes.

HOLMES: Don't worry, Watson. In this case, I think honesty will be the best policy.

WATSON: Well, I'm not so sure. This place is a thieves' kitchen, if ever I saw one. You'd better be careful.

HOLMES: First door to the right at the top of the stairs. This is it. [X]

AYISHA: (BEHIND DOOR) Come in!

SFX: DOOR OPENS

AYISHA: (SEDUCTIVE) Oh, come and sit over here, Mr. Englishman. (HARSH) Greasy one! You may leave us!

SFX: DOOR SHUTS

HOLMES: Mademoiselle, I, uh, may as well tell you at once that I am not an Arab guide. My name is Sherlock Holmes.

AYISHA: What do you want with me? Why you trick your way in here?

HOLMES: Don't be frightened, Mademoiselle. I can explain our mission in a very few words. My friend and I have come in search of an Englishman by the name of Douglas Milton. We have good news for him. 

AYISHA: What make you think I might know of him?

HOLMES: A gentleman by the name of Rafi suggested that you might.

AYISHA: What is your good news for this Englishman?

HOLMES: That he has been cleared of suspicion of murder and that he is the rightful Earl of Montrevor.

AYISHA: (UNHAPPY) That means when he knows this, he will leave the Casbah and return to his country?

WATSON: Naturally, my dear.

AYISHA: (BEAT, UNCONVINCING) I do not know this man. I have never heard of him. (DECISIVE) Here is your five hundred francs. Goodbye! 

SFX: MILTON'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACH BEHIND--

MILTON: (FADES IN) Not so fast, Ayisha, ma petite chou. I've been listening from behind these curtains. Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Douglas Milton.

WATSON: Douglas Milton! We've found you at last! (CHUCKLES)

HOLMES: It gives me infinite pleasure to have succeeded in my mission. How do you do, sir?

MILTON: This is very exciting. 

WATSON: It is indeed.

MILTON: Yes, I think the occasion calls for a drink. Uh, what'll it be, gentlemen?

WATSON: Oh, I think - a glass of port would be very nice, sir.

HOLMES: Yes, it would be most appropriate for toasting the new Earl of Montrevor.

MILTON: Splendid, splendid. Ayisha, bring glasses and a bottle of port, and some crème de menthe for me.

AYISHA: You are not going to England! I will never let you leave me!

MILTON: Oh, stop being so melodramatic, Ayisha. Please bring two bottles and some glasses.

AYISHA: Wery well. I am sorry.

MILTON: Mr. Holmes, I can't tell you how I appreciate your trouble in coming all this way to find me, but, well, I must tell you at once, there's one problem that makes it difficult for me to leave this country. You see, I - I deserted from the Foreign Legion.

WATSON: Yes, yes, yes, we know that, my boy. In fact, that's how we first got onto your trail.

HOLMES: I shouldn't let that fact worry you, Mr. Milton. I'm certain the British consul in Algiers can arrange to have any charges dropped against a peer of the realm.

MILTON: Oh, well, I never thought of that.

AYISHA: (APPROACHES) Here are the bottles.

SFX: BOTTLES UNCORKED, CONTENTS POURED, GLASSES CLINK, ET CETERA, BEHIND--

MILTON: You must excuse the glasses, gentlemen. Tumblers are hardly correct, I suppose, but-- Well, they won't spoil the flavor, I'm sure. Ah, two glasses of port and, er, crème de menthe for me. Only three glasses, Ayisha? Bring a glass for yourself.

AYISHA: (DEFIANT) I do not wish to drink.

MILTON: And I insist that you do. Bring a glass, Ayisha.

AYISHA: (MOVING OFF) Why should I drink if you are leaving me?

HOLMES: Mr. Milton, do you know Oliver Leaming?

MILTON: Huh? Of course. He's my cousin. Yes, he came here half an hour ago and threatened me.

WATSON: Did you also know that he's lying dead in the street -- murdered?

MILTON: (RELUCTANT, LOW) Well, yes. Yes, I did. If we weren't in the Casbah, I wouldn't tell you this, but-- Ayisha stabbed him. She followed him when he left here, killed him, and then slipped back just in time to sing her song a few moments ago. Oh, you needn't look so shocked, Dr. Watson. Life is cheap in the Casbah and Ayisha is a girl of violent passions. (UP) Come on, let's - let's drink.

HOLMES: A toast to the new Earl of Montrevor.

SFX: GLASSES CLINK ... THE MEN DRINK

MILTON: (COUGHS, GASPS) 

WATSON: Excuse me, sir. You took the wrong glass. You're drinking my port.

MILTON: Oh, silly mistake; I can't bear port. Very un-English of me, I'm afraid, but-- Well, after all these years, I don't feel particularly English. In fact, I'll probably find it very hard to adjust myself to the old life when I go back. Or perhaps I should say if I go back.

HOLMES: Since you feel that way about it, Mr. Milton, why go? You can claim the title and the revenues of the estate without leaving Algeria. You could stay here and live on the income. 

MILTON: I didn't realize that would be possible. Are you sure I could do that?

HOLMES: Oh, yes, I'm quite certain of it.
MILTON: Hmm. 

HOLMES: But if you doubt my word, I suggest we all adjourn to the British consulate in Algiers. They can put you straight on the matter.

MILTON: That's a good idea. Let's go over there at once. 

AYISHA: (APPROACHES, UPSET) And now I have been listening to you, my friend! You are planning to leave me! Once you go from the Casbah, I shall never see you again!

SFX: MILTON AND AYISHA STRUGGLE ... IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

MILTON: Put down that knife, Ayisha!

AYISHA: I will not let you go! You belong to me! If you try to leave me now, I WILL KILL YOU! 

MILTON: Put down that knife, Ayisha! You've done enough damage for one night!

AYISHA: Why, you--!

MILTON: Put it down, you fool! Put it down!

AYISHA: Let me go! Let me go! (SCREAMS, GASPS, DYING)

SFX: AYISHA COLLAPSES TO THE FLOOR

MILTON: (EXHALES IN HORROR) She - twisted the knife on herself as she fell.

WATSON: Holmes, help me turn her over.

SFX: AYISHA'S BODY TURNED OVER

WATSON: She's dead, Mr. Milton.

MILTON: Poor Ayisha.

HOLMES: It's a bloody path that leads to the Montrevor title, sir. I suggest that we see that this poor girl's body is taken care of. And then go to the British consulate without any further delay.

MUSIC: ORGAN ... BRIDGE

HOLMES: Now that we're at the consulate, Mr. Milton, I suggest that you swear on oath that you are Douglas Milton, heir to the Montrevor estate -- this gentleman is a commissioner of oaths -- then we can go in and see the consul.

MILTON: Very well.

COMMISSIONER: Now, raise your right hand and repeat after me. "I hereby solemnly swear that I am Douglas Milton, the missing heir to the Montrevor estate."

MILTON: I hereby swear that I am Douglas Milton, missing heir to the Montrevor estate.

COMMISSIONER: Thank you, sir. And now if you'll sign the statement here, these gentlemen can witness it.

SFX: RATTLE OF PAPER ... SCRIBBLE OF SIGNATURE

MILTON: There you are.

COMMISSIONER: Thank you, sir. And now if you gentlemen will sign.

HOLMES: Yes, certainly.

SFX: SCRIBBLES, OF HOLMES AND WATSON

COMMISSIONER: Thank you, gentlemen. The document is now legal.

MILTON: Splendid. Let's go over and see the consul.

HOLMES: Not yet, my friend. Watson, this man is not Douglas Milton.

MILTON: What the devil are you talking about?

HOLMES: There is no law in the Casbah, sir, so you cannot be punished for the two murders you committed there. But now that your avarice has tempted you here to Algiers where you've been foolish enough to sign a false statement, I think we can at least settle you very nicely for desertion, false impersonation, forgery and perjury.

WATSON: Holmes, what do you mean?

HOLMES: The story should be obvious, old fellow. Oliver Leaming did track down the deserter. Recognition was uncertain after so many years, but at least it gave this gentleman the idea of impersonating the real Douglas Milton, a friend of his.

MILTON: You have a lively imagination, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: The real Douglas Milton died of dysentery two years ago in Sidi Rached. As soon as the idea of impersonating Milton was born, Leaming had to die. 

MILTON: Your theories are very interesting, but you haven't a shred of proof. I say that I'm Douglas Milton. How are you going to prove otherwise?

HOLMES: Very simply, my dear sir. Douglas Milton was a painter -- a painter who excelled in the use of vivid colors. You, sir, suffer from the quite common malady of red-green color blindness. Less than an hour ago, you mistook a glass of port, which is red, for a glass of crème de menthe, which is green. I knew at once that you were an impostor.

MILTON: You're cleverer than I thought you were, Holmes. (RUNNING OFF) Goodbye!

SFX: RUNNING FOOTSTEPS AWAY ... DOOR OPENS OFF

WATSON: (PANIC) Here, here! Come back!

HOLMES: (CALM) No, no, Watson. Don't go after him.

WATSON: But we can't let him escape, Holmes!

HOLMES: Don't worry, old chap, he won't escape. I sent a message to Colonel de Brisson. If you go to the window, I think you'll find that the consulate is being watched.

SFX: FOOTSTEPS TO WINDOW

HOLMES: The Legion has a long memory for desertion. I don't think he'll get very far.

SFX: VOLLEY OF RIFLE SHOTS, OFF

WATSON: They got him, Holmes! Shot him as he was trying to run away!

HOLMES: A just death for him. He lived a life of violence and treachery, Watson. It's only fitting that he should die in the same manner.

MUSIC: ORGAN ... FOR A FINISH

ANNOUNCER: Doctor, that was a swell story, but-- You know something? I wish you hadn't disillusioned me about the Casbah.

WATSON: Disillusioned you? Why, what do you mean?

ANNOUNCER: Well, before I heard your story, whenever somebody mentioned the Casbah, I'd always visualize a very glamorous, romantic sort of place, full of beautiful women -- every one of 'em a ringer for Hedy Lamarr.

WATSON: No!

ANNOUNCER: Yup!

WATSON: (CHUCKLES)

ANNOUNCER: And I could just see myself -- handsome, dashing -- going up to one of those beautiful girls and whispering in my fine French accent-- (FRENCH ACCENT, IMITATES CHARLES BOYER) Darling, you are sensational. You are lovely. Gorgeous. Tell me-- (DROPS ACCENT) Have you ever tried Petri Wine? It's wonderful. (PAUSE FOR STUDIO AUDIENCE'S MIXED REACTION) Well, you must admit, Doctor, that that is the truth. It is wonderful wine. It certainly ought to be.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) You're incorrigible.

ANNOUNCER: (LAUGHS) After all, winemaking has been the business of the Petri family ever since way back in the eighteen hundreds. For generations, the Petri family has handed down from father to son, from father to son, the fine art of turning luscious, sun-ripened grapes into fragrant delicious wine. And don't forget -- because the making of Petri Wine is a family affair, the letters P-E-T-R-I on a bottle of wine are the personal assurance of the Petri family that every drop of wine in that bottle is good wine. So no matter what type wine you prefer for any occasion, remember you can't go wrong with a Petri Wine because Petri Took Time / to Bring You Good Wine!

Well, Doctor, I suppose you're ready to tell us about next week's story?

WATSON: Yes, and as soon as I have, I want you to meet a friend of mine. 

ANNOUNCER: A friend?

WATSON: Yes. But first, Mr. Bartell, next week I'm going to tell you an adventure in which for once Holmes came off second best. An exciting story of high society and romance. I call it "A Scandal in Bohemia."

ANNOUNCER: Boy, that sounds swell. And now what about your friend?

WATSON: Well, he's waiting at the microphone in San Francisco. He's Dr. Langley Porter and he wants to tell us about something very important. Dr. Langley Porter!

PORTER: Thank you, Dr. Watson. Radio listeners, tonight in Italy there are thousands, many thousands, dying of cold and hunger -- babies, children, expectant mothers, old folks -- dying for want of clothes, want of food. This organization, American Relief for Italy, appeals to you to search your homes for anything that can be made useful for starving, freezing men, women, children -- clothing, layettes for babies, diapers, shoes, food, surgical supplies, but, above all, clothes; clean clothes, fit to wear. Take them to the nearest fire station. 

That your gifts will reach the Italians who need them you may be sure. Americans of this organization will distribute the packages in Italy through the Italian Red Cross, the Catholic Relief Organization, the League of Italian Women, the Confederation of Italian Labor and the Italian government. 

In California, rationing has gone; Christmas comes. There, in Italy, death is on the prowl. Radio listeners, lives can be saved. It's up to you.

WATSON: Thank you, Dr. Langley Porter. I know that our friends listening in will do all that they can to help the organization, American Relief for Italy.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: The Petri family -- the family that took time to bring you good wine -- invites you to listen to Dr. Watson tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective, Sherlock Holmes. And you know something? I had an adventure tonight I wish you could have shared with me. I had a steak about, oh, an inch and a half thick, tender and juicy, and with it I had a glass of Petri California Burgundy. Now there's a combination -- steak and Petri Burgundy. That Petri Burgundy is a perfect mealtime wine. It's a rich, red wine that's hearty and full of flavor -- flavor that comes right from the heart of the grape. And don't think that Petri Burgundy is only good with steak -- it'll make a hamburger sandwich taste like a feast, too. Try Petri Burgundy with any meat or meat dish. It's just wonderful! And serve it proudly, too, because after all, the name Petri is the proudest name in the history of American wines.

WATSON: (BEHIND DOOR) Come in. Come in, come in.

ANNOUNCER: Good evening, Dr. Watson. 

WATSON: Good evening, Mr. Bartell.

SOUND: DOOR SHUTS 

WATSON: You're quite muffled up tonight, I see. Overcoat, scarf and gloves. Slip 'em off and come and join me by the fire.

ANNOUNCER: Thanks, doctor. Quite a nip in the air tonight.

WATSON: Yes, there is indeed.

ANNOUNCER: Well, doctor, you told us last week that tonight's story centered around the activities of a brilliant and beautiful woman.

WATSON: Yes, my boy. Her name was Irene Adler. But I never knew Holmes to refer to her by any other name than "The Woman."

ANNOUNCER: She sounds mighty intriguing. How did you happen to meet up with her?

WATSON: Well, I'll tell you the story from the beginning. One night -- it was on the twentieth of March, Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Eight, to be exact -- I was returning home from a visit to a patient, when my steps led me through Baker Street. Since my marriage, I hadn't seen much of Sherlock Holmes and--

ANNOUNCER: You couldn't resist stopping by Two-Twenty-One B, I'm sure, doctor.

WATSON: Of course I couldn't. As I stood outside the well-remembered door, I looked up at the lighted windows and saw the tall, spare figure of my old friend pass twice in dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk on his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was hot on the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and a few moments later, found myself standing before him. (FADES OUT)

HOLMES: (FADES IN) Marriage suits you, Watson. You look in splendid shape.

WATSON: Yes, Holmes, I'm feeling very well, thanks.

HOLMES: And in practice again, I see. You didn't tell me that you'd gone back into harness.

WATSON: (SURPRISED) Oh? How do you know?

HOLMES: Elementary, my dear chap. If a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver on his right forefinger and a bulge on the left side of his hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I should be dull, indeed, if I didn't pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) Same as ever, Holmes. By the way, I'm, uh-- I'm not interrupting you, am I?

HOLMES: Yes, you are, old fellow, but it's a most welcome interruption.

WATSON: You're working on a new case?

HOLMES: It looks like it. This letter arrived by the last post today. It's undated, and has neither signature nor address. Read it.

WATSON: (MUMBLES) Let's have a look. (READS) "There will call upon you tonight, at a quarter to eight o'clock, a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted. This account of you we have from all quarters received." (TO HIMSELF) Hm! (READS) "Be in your chamber, then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask." (TO HOLMES) Great Scott, it all sounds very mysterious. What do you imagine it means?

HOLMES: Look carefully at the note, Watson. What do you deduce from it?

WATSON: Oh, let's see. Well, the man who wrote it was presumably well-to-do. Such paper couldn't be bought for under half a crown a packet. And it's peculiarly strong and stiff.

HOLMES: Peculiar -- that's the very word. It's not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light. You notice anything?

WATSON: Yes. There's a large "E" with a small "g"--

HOLMES: (AGREES) Mm hm.

WATSON: --and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

HOLMES: What does that suggest to you?

WATSON: The name of the maker, no doubt; or perhaps his monogram.

HOLMES: Not at all, my dear fellow. The "G" with the small "t" stands for "Gesellschaft," which is the German for "Company."

WATSON: And the "E - g"? 

HOLMES: That stands for Egria. 

WATSON: Egria?

HOLMES: It's in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 

WATSON: So the paper was made in Bohemia. 

HOLMES: Undoubtedly. And the man who wrote the note is a German.

WATSON: How do you know that?

HOLMES: Observe the curious construction of the sentence, "This account of you we have from all quarters received." A Frenchman or a Russian could not have written that. It's the German who is so discourteous to his verbs.

SOUND: VICTORIAN DOORBELL JANGLES, OFF

WATSON: There's your client now. I'd better go, Holmes. 

HOLMES: No, no, no, no -- unless you have to. 

WATSON: Well, I could stay; I thought perhaps that--

HOLMES: Then, my dear chap, stay. by all means. I'm lost without my Boswell, and this promises to be interesting. I told Mrs. Hudson to let the masked visitor come upstairs unannounced.

SOUND: KNOCK ON DOOR
HOLMES: Come in.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS 

HOLMES: Good evening, sir. 

KING: You, uh-- You received my note?

HOLMES: Yes, indeed. Come in, won't you, and sit down? 

SOUND: KING WALKS TO CHAIR AND SITS BEHIND--

HOLMES: This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. You may say anything before him that you can say to me. Whom have I the honor to address?

KING: You may address me as, er, Count Von Kramm.

WATSON: How do you do, sir?

KING: You must excuse this mask that I wear. The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.

HOLMES: I was well aware of that fact, sir. 

KING: You see, Mr. Holmes, the matter I am about to discuss implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.

HOLMES: That had not escaped me either, sir. In fact, if you will state your case, I shall be better able to advise you -- your Majesty.

KING: (ASTONISHED) How--? How did you--? (DECISIVELY) Yes. Yes, I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?

HOLMES: Why, indeed?

KING: I shall remove the mask. (BEAT) There. Mr. Holmes, I have traveled incognito from Prague for the express purpose of consulting you.

HOLMES: Then, pray consult. 

KING: Briefly, the facts are these. Some five years ago, during a visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.

WATSON: Irene Adler? We know of her, your Majesty.

HOLMES: Look her up in the index for me, will you, Watson? It's right beside you on the desk there.

KING: I imagined that her name would not be unfamiliar to you. 

SOUND: SHUFFLE OF PAPERS ... IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

WATSON: Here we are, here we are. (READS) "A. Abrahams, Actongreen (Hatchet Murders), Adler--" Adler.

HOLMES: Splendid. Hand me the file, old chap. Thank you. Mm hm! (READS AND MUSES) "Irene Adler. Born in New Jersey in the United States of America in Eighteen Fifty-Eight. Contralto." Mm hm. "Prima donna, Imperial Opera of Warsaw." Oh. "Retired from operatic stage. Living in London." Quite so. And here's a recent notation -- uh huh. (TO KING) Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back.

KING: (AMAZED) Precisely so. But how could--?

HOLMES: Was there a secret marriage?

KING: None.

HOLMES: No legal papers or certificates?

KING: Er, no.

HOLMES: Then I fail to follow, your Majesty. If this young lady should produce her letters for blackmailing purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?

KING: There is the handwriting.

WATSON: That could be a forgery, your Majesty.

KING: But it was private note-paper.

HOLMES: Stolen.

KING: My own seal.

HOLMES: Imitated.

KING: My photograph.

HOLMES: Bought.

KING: But - we were both in the photograph.

HOLMES: Oh, dear me. Yes, that's very bad. Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.

WATSON: Did you inscribe this photograph, your Majesty?

KING: Yes, Dr. Watson, I am afraid I did. 

WATSON: (MUMBLES) Good gracious me.

KING: Mr. Holmes, it must be recovered. 

HOLMES: Perhaps if you were to pay enough, the photograph might be bought. 

KING: She refuses to sell. 

HOLMES: Stolen, then.

KING: Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.

HOLMES: Oh, dear, it's quite a pretty little problem. 

KING: It is a deadly serious one to me. 

WATSON: Your Majesty, what does Miss Adler intend to do with the photograph? 

KING: To ruin me. 

HOLMES: How, sir?

KING: Well, I am about to be married to the second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. She is the [very] soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.

HOLMES: And Irene Adler threatens to send the photograph to your fiancée, I suppose? 

KING: Yes, and she will do it. Rather than let me marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go. None.

WATSON: Are you sure that she hasn't already sent it, your Majesty?

KING: I am sure.

HOLMES: And why?

KING: She said she would send it on the day my betrothal is publicly announced. That day will be next Monday.

HOLMES: Splendid! Then we still have three days. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?

KING: Yes, certainly. You will find me at the Langham Hotel, registered as Count Von Kramm.

HOLMES: Just two questions before you leave. 

KING: What are they? 

HOLMES: Is the photograph large or small? 

KING: Quite large. And it was in a heavy frame.

HOLMES: I see. And what is Irene Adler's London address, please?

KING: Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.

HOLMES: Thank you, your Majesty. Good night, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.

KING: (RISES) I am placing all my hopes in you, Mr. Holmes. (MOVING OFF) Good night. Good night, Dr. Watson.

WATSON: Good night, your Majesty. 

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

WATSON: Fascinating problem, Holmes. I wish I could help you with it. 

HOLMES: You can, my dear chap. I shall be glad of your company. 

WATSON: What's our first move, Holmes? 

HOLMES: A good night's rest. We'll meet here at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. 

WATSON: And then?

HOLMES: Then, my dear fellow, we will see what we can find out about Miss Irene Adler, late of the Warsaw Imperial Opera Company and at present residing at Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.

MUSIC: BRIDGE 

WATSON: Well, Holmes, I guess the examination of Briony Lodge didn't prove very illuminating.

HOLMES: No. A bijou residence that represents the essence of dignified suburbia, but tells us very little about the owner. I think a visit to the local public house might prove more instructive. Come on, old chap. I see the door of the Coach and Horse is inviting us from across the road.

SOUND: TWO PAIRS OF FOOTSTEPS ON COBBLESTONE

WATSON: Well, our disguises shouldn't cause any suspicion.

HOLMES: [That's why] I suggested them. In the character of a couple of stable hands, I felt that we might inspire confidence. This is a horsy neighborhood, and there's a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among their fraternity. Here we are. Better let me do most of the talking.

WATSON: Yes, I will. I'm sure that your accent will be more convincing than mine.

HOLMES: Let's go in, shall we?

BARTENDER: Don't mind if I do. I'll have a Guinness. You blokes new around here?

HOLMES: (COCKNEY) Oh, yes. We just come over from Clapham.

BARTENDER: Clapham, eh? Well, here's looking at you. (DRINKS, EXHALES) You hunting for jobs?

HOLMES: (COCKNEY) Yes, that's right. We was told that Miss Adler across at Briony Lodge needed a new coachman and groom.

BARTENDER: Well, it's the first I've heard of it -- but it might be true. Have you been over there to ask?

HOLMES: (COCKNEY) No, not yet. We thought we'd find out something about the old girl first.

BARTENDER: (CHUCKLES) She ain't no old girl, matey. She's the prettiest young thing you ever saw under a bonnet, and that's a fact.

WATSON: (COCKNEY) You know her, governor? 

BARTENDER: Yeah, of course I know her. Used to drive her carriage, I did, afore I come to work here. 

HOLMES: (COCKNEY) Oh. What's she like? 

BARTENDER: Well, as nice a little lady as you'll find, chum. 

WATSON: (COCKNEY) Work you hard?

BARTENDER: No. No, no. She lives quiet, like. Goes out singing at concerts once in a while. Rest of the time, it's money for gin. She goes out for a drive in the park every day at five and comes back to dinner at six-thirty. Rest of the time's your own.

HOLMES: (COCKNEY) Oh, she ain't married, you say?

BARTENDER: No, no. But she's got a bloke what comes to see her all the time. He's a barrister; nice gentleman. Mr. Geoffrey Norton is his name. Good looking fella; wouldn't be surprised to see 'em get spliced.

HOLMES: (COCKNEY) Sounds like a nice, cushy job to me. (TO WATSON) Come on, Charley, let's get over to the house and see what's what. (TO BARTENDER) Much obliged to you, chum. 

BARTENDER: Good luck, mateys. 

WATSON: (COCKNEY) Good night.

BARTENDER: And thanks for the Guinness! 

SOUND: PUB DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS ... PUB BACKGROUND OUT

WATSON: What's our next move, Holmes?

HOLMES: Let's stroll back to Briony Lodge, shall we? I'm undecided whether to continue my investigations there or to try and find out something about Mr. Geoffrey Norton, the barrister. If he is just her lawyer and nothing else, it's more than likely that she's entrusted the photograph to his safekeeping.

WATSON: Hello, there's a cab waiting outside Miss Adler's house. 

HOLMES: Hurry, Watson. It may be Mr. Norton's.

SOUND: THEIR HURRIED FOOTSTEPS TO THE FRONT GATE

WATSON: (LOW) Here we are at the gate.

HOLMES: (LOW) Yes! And here comes a man hurrying down the pathway. Quick -- behind this post. Listen!

SOUND: NORTON'S FOOTSTEPS RUN TO CAB 

1ST CABMAN: Where to now, Mr. Norton?

NORTON: Drive like the devil! First to Gross and Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a sovereign if you do it in twenty minutes!

1ST CABMAN: Right you are, Mr. Norton! Hop in! 

SOUND: NORTON CLIMBS IN ... CAB DOOR SHUTS 

HOLMES: (LOW) Try and signal a cab, Watson! We must follow him!

SOUND: CAB DRIVES DOWN ROAD 

WATSON: Here comes one! No, no, it isn't. It's a private carriage.

HOLMES: Miss Adler's, no doubt! (LOW) Here she comes down the pathway. Back again behind the post, Watson!

SOUND: ADLER'S FOOTSTEPS RUNNING TOWARD CARRIAGE 

COACHMAN: Where to, Miss Adler?

ADLER: The Church of St. Monica, John, and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.

SOUND: CARRIAGE DOOR SHUTS ... CARRIAGE DRIVES DOWN ROAD 

HOLMES: The game's afoot! Quick, we must get a cab and follow them! 

WATSON: Here comes a hansom!

SOUND: HANSOM CAB PULLS UP ... THEN STOPS BEHIND--

WATSON: (CALLS) Cabby! Hey, hey, cabby!

2ND CABMAN: (SKEPTICAL) Have you blokes got enough money to take a cab?

HOLMES: Here's half a sovereign for you, my man!

2ND CABMAN: Right you are! Where to, governor?

HOLMES: The Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road, and another half sovereign for you if you get us there in twenty minutes!

SOUND: CAB DOOR SHUTS ... CAB DRIVES DOWN ROAD 

MUSIC: CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: We'll hear the rest of Dr. Watson's story in just a second, but let me tell you something. If you're going to have chicken for dinner tomorrow night or - or any night, don't forget to serve that chicken with Petri California Sauterne. Believe me, Petri Sauterne is just about the last word in white wines. It's beautifully golden in color, it's delicate and intriguing in flavor and it's just-- Well, you taste it and see for yourself. If you want a delicious white wine, you certainly want Petri Sauterne. (TO WATSON) Well, doctor, again you broke off your story at the most exciting point. Did you and Sherlock Holmes reach that church inside the twenty minutes?

WATSON: Yes, Mr. Bartell, we did, but the other carriages were there before us. Holmes went into the church after telling me to guard the outside. I must have waited for ten minutes or more before Mr. Geoffrey Norton and Miss Adler came out, spoke a few words to each other and then left -- then and there, in their separate conveyances. A moment later, Holmes -- still dressed as a stable hand -- came striding out of the church and down the steps towards me. He was obviously very excited. (FADES OUT) 

HOLMES: (FADES IN) Watson! Watson, have they left? 

WATSON: Yes, in separate cabs. I overheard him say that he was going back to his office. And she said, "I shall drive out in the park at five o'clock, as usual." 

HOLMES: Splendid. Then come on -- we can return to Baker Street. 

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS TO CAB, DURING FOLLOWING--

WATSON: What happened inside the church, Holmes? 

HOLMES: They were married.

WATSON: Married?! 

HOLMES: Of course. The ceremony would have been illegal if performed after noon. That accounted for their wild dash to the church. Jump into the cab, old fellow. 

2ND CABMAN: Where to now, governor?

HOLMES: Two Twenty-One B, Baker Street.

SOUND: CAB DOOR OPENS ... HOLMES AND WATSON CLIMB IN ... CAB DOOR SHUTS ... CAB DRIVES DOWN ROAD, CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND 

WATSON: Oh, so they got married, eh? 

HOLMES: Yes. And it may amuse you to know that I acted as witness at the ceremony. 

WATSON: You did? But how did that happen?

HOLMES: (LAUGHS) Their own witness had failed to appear and I was dragged into the breach. The bride gave me this sovereign as a memento. I, uh, think I'll wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.

WATSON: What an amazing situation. Things begin to look better for the king, don't they? Now that she's Mrs. Norton, the chances are that she won't want to expose his Majesty, after all.

HOLMES: I hope so, Watson, I hope so. But we can't afford to take any chances. I think the time is ripe for us to come to closer grips with the lady!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

WATSON: Well, Holmes, now that we've eaten, perhaps you'll tell me your plan.

HOLMES: With pleasure, my dear fellow -- and while I'm so doing, I'll proceed with applying the makeup for my new disguise.

WATSON: (AMUSED) Another disguise? What's it to be this time?

HOLMES: I think the character and appearance of an amiable, simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman would be the most suited to my plan for entering Miss Adler's house.

WATSON: You're going to try and enter, then? 

HOLMES: I must, my dear fellow. I'm sure the photograph is there. Miss Adler -- or, rather, Mrs. Norton -- will return from her drive in the park at six-thirty. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.

WATSON: And what then?

HOLMES: You must leave that to me. I've already made my arrangements. There is only one point on which I must insist -- you must not interfere, come what may. You understand?

WATSON: I'm to remain neutral?

HOLMES: Yes. There will be some small unpleasantness. Don't join in. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. As soon as I am able to, I shall open one of the windows. You are to watch from outside. When I raise my hand, you will throw an object -- that I shall give you -- through the window and, at the same time, cry "Fire!" You follow me?

WATSON: Entirely. But what am I to throw? 

HOLMES: Oh, it's nothing very formidable. Here it is. 

WATSON: Huh. Looks like a great big cigar. What is it?

HOLMES: An ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to throwing it through the window. When you raise the cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I'll rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope I've made myself clear.

WATSON: Perfectly. 

HOLMES: Good. And now, old fellow, as soon as I've donned my clerical attire, let's be on our way. There's no time to be lost.

MUSIC: BRIDGE 

WATSON: It's nearly six-thirty, Holmes. We've been pacing up and down in front of her house for half an hour now. I hope she does come back.

HOLMES: I'm sure she will.

WATSON: There seem to be a lot of loafers hanging around her gate.

HOLMES: All part of my conspiracy, old chap. You'll see them play their parts in a few minutes.

WATSON: You still think the photograph is inside the house?

HOLMES: Yes. It's most unlikely that she carries it about with her. Remember, the king told us it was a large, framed picture. And also remember that she planned to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands on it. It must be inside her house.

WATSON: But her house has been burgled. Twice. 

HOLMES: Oh, psh! They didn't know how to look.

WATSON: How will you look? 

HOLMES: I won't. I'll get her to show me. 

WATSON: Oh, she'll refuse.

HOLMES: She won't be able to-- 

SOUND: CARRIAGE APPROACHES

HOLMES: Shh! Here comes the carriage now. Remember, Watson -- carry out my orders to the letter. 

WATSON: (MOVING OFF) You can trust me. Good luck.

SOUND: CARRIAGE ROLLS TO A STOP

ALFIE: (SARCASTIC) Blimey! 'Ere comes the Duchess of Tiddlywinks! 

SOUND: CROWD LAUGHS ... BUZZES IN BACKGROUND

ALFIE: Let's put out a carpet; she might get her tootsies wet!

PAT: Awwww, put a sock in it, Alfie!

HATTIE: Leave him alone! She's no better than she ought to be! 

SOUND: CROWD JEERS

ADLER: Please, please -- let me through! I live here!

ALFIE: Well, ain't that nice! We'll all come in and have a cup of cocoa! 

SOUND: CROWD JEERS AND LAUGHS ... GROWS INCREASINGLY UNRULY IN BACKGROUND

HOLMES: (AS THE CLERGYMAN) Move out of the way, please, and let the lady through.

HATTIE: Mind your own business! Just 'cause your collar's turned the wrong way round, you can't spoil our fun!

ALFIE: That's right, Hattie! Keep your nose out of it, parson! 

HATTIE: Stop shovin', will ya? 

ADLER: Please, please, don't fight about it!

HOLMES: I'll - I'll tell you what-- (HAUGHTY) Stop molesting the lady, please!

ALFIE: Do ya? Then how would you like a biff on the nose, Mr. Clergyman? 

SOUND: CROWD JEERS ... ALFIE PUNCHES THE CLERGYMAN WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND ... CROWD REACTS ... ALFIE RUNS AWAY ... CROWD DISPERSES BEHIND--

ADLER: (DISTRAUGHT) Oh, he hit the poor man! And then he ran away, the coward! Is the clergyman badly hurt?

ERNIE: He hit his head, ma'am, as he fell. If you asks me, he's hurt bad. 

BERT: He's bleedin' something terrible.

ERNIE: Can we bring him in, mum? He can't lie here in the street.

ADLER: Oh, why, of course. Bring him in.

ERNIE: Right you are, mum. Here, Bert--

BERT: Righto.

ERNIE: --give us a hand. 

SOUND: MEN GRUNT AS THEY LIFT BODY AND CARRY IT INTO THE HOUSE

HATTIE: (SADLY) Coo. Poor fella. 'Joo see what happened to him, mister?

WATSON: Yes, I saw, my good woman. A very convincing demonstration.

HATTIE: (DEFENSIVE) Whatcha mean?

WATSON: (LOW) Weren't you paid by, uh, a certain gentleman for this performance?

HATTIE: (DROPS HER ACT) Ohhh -- you knows about it, too. You must be a friend of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

WATSON: Yes, I am.

HATTIE: A nice gentleman. He give us five bob apiece for tonight's work. We ain't through yet, though. We gotta start yelling "Fire" when somebody tells us.

WATSON: I'm that somebody, my dear lady. There's Mr. Holmes now. He's inside the house!

HATTIE: Yes! He's opening a window! 

WATSON: Now he's raising his hand -- that's my signal. Now, to throw the rocket! (GRUNTS WITH EFFORT) Ah! There we are. (YELLS) Fire! 

SOUND: CROWD STARTS YELLING "FIRE! FIRE!" 

MUSIC: BRIDGE 

SOUND: HOLMES' BRISK FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

WATSON: Holmes -- there you are! You - you have the photograph? 

HOLMES: No, but I know where it is. She showed me, as I told you she would. 

WATSON: Well, I'm still in the dark.

HOLMES: There's no mystery, old chap. When my accomplices started the row in the street, I had a little moist red paint in my hand. My good friend Alfie pretended to strike me; I clapped my hand to my head and fell down. It's an old trick.

WATSON: Yes, I understand that, but how did my throwing the rocket help you?

HOLMES: It was all-important, my dear fellow. When a woman thinks her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush for the thing that she values most. A married woman grabs her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. In this case, of course, it was the photograph.

WATSON: Where was it?

HOLMES: In a recess in the living room, just above the right-hand bell-pull. I caught a glimpse of it as she drew it out. When I made it known that the fire was a false alarm, she replaced the photograph. As soon as I was able to, I advised her that I was feeling well enough to leave.

WATSON: You didn't take the photograph, then.

HOLMES: No, I felt that over-precipitance at this stage might ruin everything.

WATSON: What do we do now? 

HOLMES: Drive to the Langham Hotel and inform his Majesty of what has happened. Then return with him here. And after that, my dear chap, the case will be ended!

MUSIC: BRIDGE 

SOUND: CAB PULLS TO A STOP

WATSON: This is Briony Lodge, your Majesty. 

KING: I am all impatience. You are certain the photograph will still be there, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: I have every reason to believe so, your Majesty.

SOUND: THE THREE CLIMB OUT OF THE CAB AND WALK TO FRONT DOOR, DURING FOLLOWING--

KING: I must confess, this is going to be something of an ordeal.

HOLMES: Then I suggest that you let me do the talking, your Majesty. I think I know how to handle the lady.

SOUND: KNOCKS ON FRONT DOOR ... DOOR OPENS

MAID: Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?

HOLMES: (MILDLY SURPRISED) Yes. I am Mr. Holmes. But - how did you know?

MAID: My mistress told me you would be likely to call. She's left for the Continent with her husband.

WATSON: You mean she's left England? 

MAID: Never to return. 

KING: (DISTRESSED) Then the papers -- and the photograph? Oh, all is lost!

HOLMES: We'll soon see. Follow me. 

SOUND: THEIR HURRIED FOOTSTEPS INTO THE HOUSE

MAID: (SLIGHTLY MOCKING) She said you'd be looking for something. I hope you find it! 

HOLMES: This was the bell-rope. Sliding panel behind it. 

SOUND: HOLMES TAPS SEVERAL TIMES ON THE WALL

HOLMES: Uh huh. Here it is. 

SOUND: PANEL SLIDES OPEN

KING: (BEAT) Is - is the photograph there, Mr. Holmes? 

HOLMES: (UNHAPPY) There is a photograph, your Majesty. But it's, um, a photograph of the lady alone. Here's a letter -- and it's addressed to me.

SOUND: ENVELOPE TORN OPEN, LETTER UNFOLDED

WATSON: What does it say, Holmes?

HOLMES: (READS) "My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You really did it very well. Until after the fire alarm, I had no suspicion. But then, when I realized how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned that if the King employed an agent he would certainly employ you. May I congratulate you on your disguise as a dear, old clergyman."

WATSON: (AMUSED) Great Scott! She was much more clever than you thought, Holmes!

KING: (IMPATIENT) Ja, ja, go on. What else does it say?

HOLMES: (CLEARS THROAT, READS) "My husband and I both thought that the best recourse was flight, so you will find the nest empty. As to the photograph of the King and myself, his Majesty may rest in peace." (TO HIMSELF) Oh, thank goodness for that. (READS) "I love and am loved by a better man than he. I leave another photograph, however, that he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours, Irene Norton, née Adler." (IMPRESSED, EXCITED) What a woman, Watson; what a woman; what a magnificent woman! She fooled me completely! (CATCHES HIMSELF) But-- Oh. I, uh-- I'm sorry, your Majesty, I - I've been unable to bring your business to a more successful conclusion.

KING: On the contrary, my dear sir. Nothing could be more successful. I know that Irene's word is inviolate. The incriminating photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.

WATSON: Well, I'm glad to hear your Majesty say so. 

KING: I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. Uh, this - this beryl ring that I wear. I - I should be proud to--

HOLMES: Your Majesty has something that I should value even more highly.

KING: You have but to name it.

HOLMES: This photograph, sir.

KING: Irene's photograph? But certainly. However, you must let me give you something more substantial.

HOLMES: Oh no, no, no, your Majesty. This is something I shall treasure all my life. This and a golden sovereign I received from the lady's hand. They will remind me that I was once tricked by a woman! A woman that I shall never forget.

MUSIC: CURTAIN 

ANNOUNCER: Gee, doctor, what a woman, that Miss Adler. Or should I say Mrs. Norton. (SIGHS) That's the kind of woman I could really go for.

WATSON: Yes, I believe you could. Just between ourselves, you know, I sort of -- ahem -- sort of could go for her meself.

ANNOUNCER: She was intelligent.

WATSON: She was rich.

ANNOUNCER: And beautiful. That's the kind of woman you want sitting next to you in front of a cozy fire on a nippy fall night. Just the three of you.

WATSON: The three of you? 

ANNOUNCER: Mm hm. You. She. And a glass of Petri Port. 

WATSON: (LAUGHS) Mr. Bartell--! 

ANNOUNCER: Well, why not?

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) Gracious.

ANNOUNCER: Petri California Port is some wine! Boy, that Petri family really knows how to make good wine, all right. And no wonder. Look at all the experience they've had. Ever since they started the Petri business, way back in the eighteen hundreds, the Petri family has handed down from father to son -- from father to son -- the art of selecting perfect, sun-ripened California grapes and making them into clear, fragrant, delicious wine. Those letters -- P-E-T-R-I -- on the label of every bottle of Petri wine are the personal assurance of the Petri family that every drop of wine in that bottle is good wine. It's got to be! Because Petri took time to bring you good wine. (TO WATSON) Well, Dr. Watson, that was a great story you told us tonight.

WATSON: I thought you'd like it, Mr. Bartell. That's why I plan to tell you a sequel to it next week.

ANNOUNCER: A sequel? Say, that sounds exciting, doctor. 

WATSON: Oh, I think you'll find it proves to be, Mr. Bartell. It's a story that takes place twenty years after tonight's adventure. Once again, the principal part is played by a woman. Only in this case, it isn't Irene Adler. It's her daughter. (BEAT) Oh, and, uh, now, Mr. Bartell, before I go I want to remind our listeners that they owe a real debt of gratitude to the Selective Service Boards in their communities. At this moment, the Selective Service Boards are working harder than ever, making sure that every returning veteran knows his rights and privileges. And the Boards are helping him take full advantage of those rights and privileges. They're helping our veterans get jobs. Our Selective Service Boards deserve our sincere thanks and they deserve our cooperation. They have done -- and they are doing -- a splendid job.

MUSIC: FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN OUT

ANNOUNCER: The Petri Family -- the Family that Took Time / to Bring you Good Wine -- invites you to listen to Dr. Watson tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective, Sherlock Holmes.

Well, right about now you are probably taking a little breather in your last-minute rush to get everything ready for the big day tomorrow. Children have to be put to bed to wait for Santa Claus and there's the tree waiting to be decorated and, oh, a million and one things which must be done before morning.

I sure hope you got all your Christmas shopping done. It's pretty hectic rushing off at the last minute to take care of Uncle Charlie or Aunt Bertha or cousin Sam. But if you must get something, just remember that you can always dash over to your wine merchant and get a bottle or two of Petri Wine. Or better yet, a whole case of Petri Wine! Petri Wine's a swell gift and I just thought a little last-minute suggestion might be of some help.

MUSIC: THEME ... FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

ANNOUNCER: And now I'm sure our good friend Dr. Watson's waiting for us, so let's go in and join him.

SOUND: KNOCK ON DOOR

WATSON: (BEHIND DOOR) Come in, come in, come in!

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

WATSON: Ah! There you are, Mr. Bartell.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

ANNOUNCER: Oh, say, doctor; I can see you're gonna have yourself quite a Christmas. Big tree in the corner with colored lights on it. Where'd you get those? Table covered with presents. You must be mighty popular.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) They aren't all for me, my boy. You see, I'm having a Christmas party tomorrow for my housekeeper's little nieces.

ANNOUNCER: Ohhh.

WATSON: I'm going to dress up as Santa Claus for 'em.

ANNOUNCER: (CHUCKLES) Well, I'm sure you'll look very convincing in the part. Oh, by the way, doctor, I, er-- I brought you a little present.

WATSON: Oh, really?

ANNOUNCER: Here it is. I hope you like it.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) It's good of you, Mr. Bartell. I've got one for you, too, here somewhere. Oh, you mustn't open it until tomorrow. Here you are, my boy.

ANNOUNCER: Thanks a lot, doctor. And, uh, now how's about tonight's story? Last week, you told us you'd chosen an adventure with a lot of "Christmassy" atmosphere.

WATSON: Yes, Mr. Bartell. My story begins on another Christmas Eve many, many years ago -- to be exact, in Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Six. At the time the adventure occurred, I must confess I didn't quite understand what was going on meself. In fact, I never did quite make head or tails of it, until Holmes took pity on me later and explained the whole thing. But I shan't try to confuse you, Mr. Bartell. I'll tell you the story exactly as it happened.

ANNOUNCER: Right you are, doctor. Let's go.

WATSON: Very well. On that Christmas Eve in Eighty-Six, I was standing in our Baker Street rooms, dressed in the costume of Santa Claus. Holmes -- his long, thin fingers pressed together -- lay back in an armchair and gazed at me quizzically, while our housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, stood by the door and-- (FADES OUT)

HUDSON: (FADES IN) Well, Dr. Watson, you make a grand Santa Claus. (CHUCKLES)

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Doesn't he, Mrs. Hudson? Try the beard on, Watson old chap.

WATSON: I'm afraid this is going to be a little uncomfortable. (STRUGGLES TO PUT ON BEARD) Uh, there. How, er--? How does it look?

HUDSON: Oh, you look just like the old man on the Christmas cards, doctor. (CHUCKLES)

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Yes, Watson, it really becomes you. The cheery twinkle of the eyes, the ruddy complexion, and the, er-- The appropriate girth. What a shame we can't obtain some snow, and a sleigh and reindeer, for you. However, I'm sure Mrs. Hudson's nieces will be very much impressed.

HUDSON: Ah, they will that, sir. And it's very kind of you, doctor, to offer to come over to the house with me. With their father in the hospital and my sister at his bedside, it would have been a very miserable Christmas without ye.

WATSON: Oh, I shall enjoy myself, but I think I'll take this beard off before we get there. (GRUNTS AS HE PULLS OFF BEARD) That's it. Are you ready to leave, Mrs. Hudson?

HUDSON: I am, sir. Will I get a cab?

WATSON: How far do we have to go?

HUDSON: Oh, Lexington Gardens, Number Twenty-Eight. It's just off the Edgware Road, doctor.

WATSON: Oh, it's not far, but, bearing in mind my costume, I suppose we'd better take a cab.

HUDSON: Aye, sir. I'll get one.

SOUND: HER FOOTSTEPS AWAY, DOOR CLOSES OFF

WATSON: Holmes, what are you going to do with yourself? I hate leaving you alone on Christmas Eve.

HOLMES: Oh, don't worry, old chap. I shall spend a profitable evening writing on my new monograph.

WATSON: Oh? What's this one about?

HOLMES: An analysis of teeth marks on pipe stems, with particular regard to indicated character.

WATSON: Oh, gracious me, how exciting. Well! I must be going!

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Don't forget your sack of presents, old fellow.

WATSON: Oh, great Scott, no, no, no.

HOLMES: Ah, when you come to distribute them, you'll find that I took the liberty of adding a few trinkets on my own behalf.

WATSON: Well, that's very thoughtful of you, Holmes.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

HUDSON: Oh, excuse me, Mr. Holmes, but there's a gentleman to see you. Says he's an old friend of yours. Here's his card, sir.

HOLMES: Oh, thank you. (BEAT) Oh! It's old Widecombe! Splendid! Ask him to come up please, Mrs. Hudson.

HUDSON: All right, sir.

HOLMES: And I hope your party is a great success, Mrs. Hudson.

HUDSON: Thank you, sir. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? Now that you have a visitor, I mean.

HOLMES: Oh, no, no, no; indeed, no, Mrs. Hudson. I can show the gentlemen out myself. You go off and have a good time.

HUDSON: (MOVING OFF) Thank you, sir.

WATSON: I wonder what Lord William wants. Perhaps I should stay and give you--

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTS) No, no, please, my dear fellow; certainly not.

WATSON: Eh?

HOLMES: You've far more important work to do. Widecombe probably wants his revenge at chess or something equally innocuous. Off with you, my dear fellow, and enjoy yourself.

WATSON: Oh, very good. Just the same, I wish you were coming with me. (MOVING OFF) I'll see you later.

HOLMES: I shall be there. (CALLS) Uh, come on up, Widecombe!

WIDECOMBE: (APPROACHES) Hello, Holmes! Oh, evening, Watson! You make a very convincing Santa Claus. Are you leaving?

WATSON: (OFF) I'm afraid so, Lord Widecombe.

WIDECOMBE: Well, good night, then.

WATSON: (OFF) Uh, good night, good night, sir.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR CLOSES, OFF

WIDECOMBE: How are you, Holmes? All alone on Christmas Eve, eh?

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Yes, Widecombe. I'm glad you came over to see me.

WIDECOMBE: Mm hm.

HOLMES: What's it to be? An evening of chess? Or have you unearthed some recent treasure of medieval pottery that we can discuss?

WIDECOMBE: Neither, Holmes. I've come to you in your professional capacity. I - I need help.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Oh, come now, Widecombe. Don't tell me that after all these years of quiet friendship, you're going to become a client.

WIDECOMBE: Yes, I'm afraid so, Holmes, though I doubt if my problem will interest you very much. It's hardly up to your rather colorful standards. Er, care for a cigar?

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Oh, thanks.

SOUND: MATCH STRIKES

HOLMES: Ah. (PUFFS ON CIGAR) Now, my dear Widecombe, what's your trouble?

WIDECOMBE: Well, I decided this year to have a little Christmas party at my town house. I'm quite comfortably off, as you know, and it occurred to me that I have several relatives and friends who are not as well off. I'm having a party for them tonight, Holmes, and I hoped you'd attend it -- disguised as Santa Claus.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES, HIGHLY AMUSED) Oh, my dear fellow, I've adopted many disguises in my time, but Father Christmas has never been one of them. Why do you want me to attend your party in disguise in any case? Are you ashamed of your friendship with a private detective or do you consider my features more acceptable when buried beneath the depths of a snowy beard?

WIDECOMBE: Now, my dear Holmes, do take me seriously. I'm not joking, I assure you.

HOLMES: Oh, of course you're not, of course you're not. You, uh-- You want me to attend your party in disguise. Why?

WIDECOMBE: I'm giving some very valuable presents -- er, diamond and onyx cufflinks, platinum and ruby earrings, and suchlike -- and I've wrapped each of the presents in bank notes.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Dear me. Where are these presents now?

WIDECOMBE: In a sack, in charge of my butler. I was going to dress up as Santa Claus and give 'em out meself, until I got the warning letter. That's why I've come to you.

HOLMES: Warning letter, eh?

WIDECOMBE: Yes. I received it by this evening's post. (UNFOLDS LETTER) Listen to this. (READS) "My dear Lord Widecombe, Your generosity with Christmas presents borders on ostentation. We do not approve. Either we receive five thousand pounds in sovereigns at Poste Restante Box Three-Seven-Nine by six o'clock on Christmas Eve or I'm afraid your Christmas party will be conspicuous by its absence of presents."

HOLMES: Let me see that note, Widecombe, will you?

WIDECOMBE: Yes, here you are.

SOUND: HANDS OVER LETTER

HOLMES: Thanks. (EXAMINING PAPER) Mm hm. Plain paper, torn from a penny notebook. Writing is obviously disguised and it-- (EXCITED) By George, yes! Widecombe -- I accept the case! I'll come with you to your party at once and, furthermore, I shall follow your suggestion regarding a disguise. Dressed as Santa Claus, I shall be less likely to attract suspicion.

WIDECOMBE: I'm delighted, Holmes. But what made you decide so suddenly?

HOLMES: This writing, my dear fellow, this writing. Though it's in a false hand, I'd know that characteristic "M" in "My dear Widecombe." I've seen it too often at the beginning of a signature. Moriarty!

WIDECOMBE: Moriarty? Who's he?

HOLMES: Oh, one of the cleverest and most unscrupulous criminals in England. Widecombe, there's no time to be lost. It's -- let me see now -- six-thirty, half an hour beyond the deadline given you in this letter. We must go to your house at once.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... "JINGLE BELLS"

SOUND: CAB COMES TO A STOP

HUDSON: This is as far as the cab can take us, doctor.

WATSON: Here you are, cabbie. Here's five shillings for you, and a merry Christmas.

1ST CABBIE: Oh, bless you, guv'nor, and a merry Christmas to you, too.

SOUND: CAB MOVES OFF

HUDSON: (CHUCKLES, TO WATSON) Ah, you said you wanted to get into the house through the back way, so that you could surprise the children.

WATSON: Yes, I thought I'd pretend to come down the kitchen chimney.

HUDSON: Oh, you can get to the back of the house by going up the alley here. I'll go in the front door.

WATSON: Splendid, splendid, Mrs. Hudson. Which is the house?

HUDSON: Number Twenty-Eight. It's the third one down the alley, doctor. I'll have the back window open in no time and you can slip in without any of the bairns seeing you.

WATSON: Very well. Gloomy little street, I must say.

MUSIC: CHURCH ORGAN, FROM OFF ... CONTINUES IN BG

WATSON: Hello -- where's the music coming from?

HUDSON: Oh, it's from that temple across the street, doctor. The Disciples of the Octagonal Square, they call themselves.

WATSON: What on earth do you suppose that means?

HUDSON: Oh, some new-fangled cult. Heathens, most likely.

MUSIC: OUT BEHIND--

WATSON: Hello, hello, hello -- I'm not the only Santa Claus abroad tonight. Look at that fellow across the street over there.

HUDSON: Oh! Dressed just like yourself, doctor, and carrying a sack, too. Oh, he's running up the steps to the temple.

WATSON: Great Scott! He - he slipped on the ice!

SOUND: WATSON AND HUDSON'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS ACROSS STREET TO TEMPLE

WATSON: (DURING ABOVE) I wonder what his hurry was. (AT THE TEMPLE) Here, here, my man! Let me help you up, sir!

HUDSON: Oh, be careful now, doctor. Dinna trip yourself.

WATSON: Here you are, sir. Now give me your hand.

LOU: (DAZED, NERVOUS) Er, thank you, thir. Er, thilly of me, wathn't it?

WATSON: Oh, we Santa Clauses have to help each other, you know. (WITH EFFORT) Up you come. That's it.

LOU: Woooo!

SOUND: WATSON AND LOU SLIP AND FALL TO PAVEMENT

WATSON: Oh, gracious me.

HUDSON: Oh, doctor, I told you to be careful. Now you've fallen, too.

WATSON: Oh, it's this confounded red coat of mine. It tripped me up!

HUDSON: Oh, did you hurt yourself, sir?

WATSON: No -- no, no, no. I'm all right, I think. (TO LOU) Uh, how about you, sir?

LOU: Oh, I'm all right, thankth. Thilly of me to run, wathn't it?

WATSON: Uh, here's your sack, sir.

LOU: Thank you. (HURRIEDLY MOVING OFF) Good night, and merry Chrithmath!

WATSON: (CALLS AFTER HIM) Good night. Same to you, sir, same to you. (TO MRS. HUDSON) Oh, he went into the temple. Must be a disciple of the Octagonal Square.

HUDSON: You're sure you're no' hurt, doctor?

WATSON: No, no, of course not, Mrs. Hudson. Give me my sack, please. (WITH EFFORT) Thank you. Your sister's house is the third one down this alleyway, you say?

HUDSON: (MOVING OFF) I'll hurry and open the back window.

WATSON: Yes, I'll be waiting for you, Mrs. Hudson. (CHUCKLES, TO HIMSELF) This is going to be rather fun. What a shame Holmes isn't with us. Oh, well, he's probably happier having a good game of chess with Lord Widecombe. (STARTS TO WHISTLE "GOOD KING WENCESLAS")

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... PICKS UP "GOOD KING WENCESLAS" / "JINGLE BELLS"

WIDECOMBE: This is my house, Holmes. Number Thirty-Nine.

HOLMES: Thirty-Nine Bronson Square, eh? (MUSES) And dear old Watson is just around the corner in Lexington Gardens and hasn't any idea that I've left Baker Street.

WIDECOMBE: Yes. Er, here you are, cabbie.

2ND CABBIE: Thank you, sir. A merry Christmas, sir.

CAROLERS: (SING "HARK! THE HERALD ANGELS SING" ... THEN IN BG)

HOLMES: Uh huh. Listen to that. Carol singers.

WIDECOMBE: Yes, we'll probably have our fill of them before this evening's over.

SOUND: HOLMES AND WIDECOMBE'S FOOTSTEPS UP STEPS TO FRONT DOOR ... HEAVY KNOCKER ... FRONT DOOR OPENS

HARGRAVE: Good evening, milord.

SOUND: HOLMES AND WIDECOMBE'S FOOTSTEPS INTO TOWN HOUSE ... DOOR SHUTS, CUTTING OFF CAROLERS

WIDECOMBE: Have the guests arrived, Hargrave?

HARGRAVE: Most of them, sir. They're in the library. You brought another Santa Claus with you, I see, milord.

HOLMES: Another Santa Claus? What do you mean?

HARGRAVE: The gentleman arrived three quarters of an hour ago, sir, dressed as Santa Claus. I took him to your study, milord, and showed him the sack of presents.

HOLMES: Confound it! He's got here before us! Where's the study?

WIDECOMBE: This way.

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS DOWN HALL BEHIND--

HARGRAVE: I hope I didn't do wrong, milord. You told me that a gentleman dressed as Santa Claus would be coming here.

SOUND: STUDY DOOR OPENS ... THEIR FOOTSTEPS IN

HARGRAVE: Dear me, the gentleman appears to have gone.

WIDECOMBE: Yes! And the sack containing the presents with him!

HARGRAVE: But he can't have left the house, milord. I've been watching the front door.

HOLMES: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Yes, and while you were doing that, he slipped out through the window here. The catch is undone.

SOUND: RATTLE OF CATCH

HOLMES: (MOVING CLOSER) Hargrave, describe this man.

HARGRAVE: I can't tell you much about his appearance, I'm afraid, sir. He was dressed as Santa Claus, just like yourself. But I did notice one thing about him, sir.

HOLMES: Oh? What was that?

HARGRAVE: He lisped, sir. It was quite pronounced.

HOLMES: Of course! Lou the Lisper!

WIDECOMBE: Who on earth is Lou the Lisper?

HOLMES: One of Moriarty's most trusted accomplices. Fortunately, though, I've had news of him lately through my underworld grapevine.

WIDECOMBE: You, er-- You know where he lives?

HOLMES: He's reputed to have some connections with a new cult that calls themselves the Disciples of the Octagonal Square. Their headquarters are just around the corner from here.

WIDECOMBE: Then let's go there at once.

HOLMES: Of course. And, Hargrave--?

HARGRAVE: Yes, sir?

HOLMES: Get a message to Scotland Yard as fast as you can. Ask for Inspector Lestrade, and tell him to join me at the Temple of the Octagonal Square in Lexington Gardens as soon as possible.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... "HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH"

HUDSON: Oh, the children are awful excited, doctor. I told them ye jist came down the chimney.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) I'll slip the beard on and then I'll go into 'em. (PUTS ON BEARD, MUFFLED) There we are.

HUDSON: Will I announce you, doctor?

WATSON: Yes, yes, please, Mrs. Hudson.

HUDSON: All right, sir.

SOUND: KITCHEN DOOR OPENS

CHILDREN: (BUZZ EXCITEDLY, THEN GROW QUIET BEHIND--)

HUDSON: Quiet now, children! Quiet! Santa Claus has come to see ye, and he's brought you all presents.

CHILDREN: (STIR EXCITEDLY AS "SANTA" ENTERS)

WATSON: Hello, hello, children!

ELSIE: Hello, Santa Claus. My name's Elsie. Did you bring me a present?

WATSON: I did, Elsie. I'll look in my sack in a minute and, uh-- What's your name, young man?

BERTIE: 'Erbert. They call me Bertie. Did you come down the chimney?!

WATSON: Yes, Bertie.

BERTIE: I bet you had a time doin' it. You're so fat!

CHILDREN: (GIGGLE)

HUDSON: Oh, don't be rude, Bertie, or Santa Claus won't give you your presents.

WATSON: And what's your name, little man?

LIONEL: Liodel. (SNIFFS) I've got a cold.

HUDSON: (SYMPATHETIC) Ohhhh.

WATSON: Yes, I see you have. Well, children, gather 'round me and I'll see what presents I've got for you.

CHILDREN: (BUZZ EXCITEDLY)

SOUND: SACK OPENED, PACKAGES REMOVED ... IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

WATSON: Er, the first present is for-- (BEAT, PUZZLED) Well, this can't be right. It says, "For Her Grace, the Dowager Duchess of Dooley."

CHILDREN: (BUZZ IMPATIENTLY)

HUDSON: (LOW) Oh, do you suppose Mr. Holmes has been playing a practical joke on you, doctor?

WATSON: (LOW) Well, I suppose so, but I can't see the point meself. But he did say that he'd added a few trinkets of his own.

ELSIE: I want my present!

WATSON: Then supposing you take this, Elsie.

ELSIE: Oh, coo! Thank you.

SOUND: PACKAGE UNWRAPPED

WATSON: And this one is marked for-- (READS, CONFUSED) "The Rev. Arthur Carter." (TO HIMSELF) Wonder what Holmes is up to. (UP) Uh, here you are, Bertie.

BERTIE: Coo! Thanks!

WATSON: And this is for you, Lionel, because you've been a good little boy.

LIONEL: 'Tisn't very big, is it? I wanted a dog.

WATSON: (TO HIMSELF) Oh, wanted a dog. Good gracious me. (UP) Well, I'll bring you a dog next year, Lionel.

CHILDREN: (BUZZ AS THEY--)

SOUND: UNWRAP PRESENTS

HUDSON: Dr. Watson--?

WATSON: Yes, Mrs. Hudson?

HUDSON: Look at the wrapping on these presents, doctor! Why, they're twenty-pound notes!

WATSON: Great Scott!

BERTIE: Oh, coo! Look what I got!

WATSON: Now, let me see. (STARTLED) Why, cufflinks! And diamond and onyx ones, unless I'm very much mistaken.

ELSIE: I got some pretty earrings. Look how they sparkle.

WATSON: Let me see those.

CHILDREN: (OOH AND AHH OVER EARRINGS)

WATSON: Good gracious, I swear that these are platinum and rubies. What in thunder's going on?

ELSIE: I want my earrings back!

BERTIE: Gimme back mine, too!

WATSON: (COWED) Well, here you are, here you are.

HUDSON: Dr. Watson, what do you suppose has happened?

WATSON: I don't know, Mrs. Hudson. Perhaps my toys are still at the bottom of the sack. I can't understand it. I wish Holmes were here instead of dozing in front of our fire in Baker Street.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... "O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM"

WIDECOMBE: Where are you, Holmes?

HOLMES: Here by the bed. This is the only room in the temple that gives any signs of having been lived in. I think our bird has been here, but I'm afraid he's flown. Wish Inspector Lestrade would get here. Strike a match, will you, Widecombe?

WIDECOMBE: Right.

SOUND: MATCH STRIKES

WIDECOMBE: Ah, here's a candle on the table.

HOLMES: Ah, just as I feared! Look on the bed.

WIDECOMBE: A red coat, and a beard.

HOLMES: Yes. Lou the Lisper has discarded his disguise and gone -- and with him, I'm afraid, your valuable presents.

WIDECOMBE: Oh, wait a minute! Here's a sack lying on the floor-- Oh, no, this isn't mine. Look what's in it. A toy dog -- large box of chocolates -- little girl's doll.

HOLMES: What in thunder--? Why, this is Watson's sack!

WIDECOMBE: But how on earth could Lou the Lisper have got hold of it?

HOLMES: Somewhere, somehow, he and Watson must have made an accidental change and Lou the Lisper is no doubt trying to track Watson down at this very moment. We must work fast, Widecombe -- or my friend's life, and those of Mrs. Hudson and her relatives, won't be worth a tinker's dam!

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: Aw, now, doctor, you can't break off your story there!

WATSON: Oh, yes, I can, my boy. Before I go on, I thought we'd have a glass of port just to - (CHUCKLES) - freshen us up.

ANNOUNCER: Oh, well, that's - (CHUCKLES) - that's something different. 'Course!

SOUND: BOTTLE UNCORKED

ANNOUNCER: Instead of talking about port as I - (CLEARS THROAT) - sometimes do, it'll be nice to drink some for a change.

SOUND: WINE POURED

WATSON: There you are, my boy, and a merry Christmas to you.

ANNOUNCER: The same to you. And now - what happened next, doctor? We left you at the children's Christmas party, and Sherlock Holmes and Lord Widecombe around the corner at the Temple of the Octagonal Square.

WATSON: Yes, Mr. Bartell. Although, at the time, of course, I had no idea what was going on. There I was, cheerfully handing out gifts worth-- Well, not a king's, at least a baronet's ransom -- while outside the Temple of the Octagonal Square, Holmes and Lord Widecombe were talking to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard-- (FADES OUT)

WIDECOMBE: (FADES IN) And that's the case in a nutshell, Lestrade.

LESTRADE: Yes. Seems to me, Lord Widecombe, you'd've been wiser to get in touch with Scotland Yard when you first got the warning note. We could have nabbed him when he came to your house and pinched the sack of presents.

HOLMES: Lestrade, this is no time for post mortems. We've got to reach Lou the Lisper before he finds Dr. Watson.

WIDECOMBE: Do you suppose he can do that, Holmes?

HOLMES: It wouldn't be difficult. Lou the Lisper is nearly as clever as his master, Professor Moriarty. The chances are that you were followed when you came to Baker Street tonight, Widecombe. And it's equally likely that Watson and Mrs. Hudson were followed as they left it. Moriarty seldom leaves anything to chance.

LESTRADE: Well, where did Dr. Watson go tonight?

HOLMES: Twenty-Eight Lexington Gardens. It's just around the corner from here.

LESTRADE: Well, then let's go there at once.

HOLMES: And frighten our quarry away? No, no, no, no, Lestrade. We must use a little subtlety. Now, Lou the Lisper wishes to recover that sack of presents from Watson. How would he invade the party with the least possible trouble?

WIDECOMBE: By, er-- By dressing up as Santa Claus again?

HOLMES: No. No, I think he's overplayed that role for one evening.

LESTRADE: Well, then how would he try to get in, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Oh, come now, Lestrade. What group of people can enter any house on Christmas Eve without invitation and without creating suspicion?

WIDECOMBE: The carol singers!

HOLMES: Exactly, my dear fellow! I shouldn't be at all surprised if at this very moment Lou the Lisper and some of his gang are singing carols outside Twenty-Eight Lexington Gardens.

LESTRADE: Well, then what are we going to do?

HOLMES: Form a rival choral society. How many of your men did you bring with you?

LESTRADE: Three, a sergeant and two constables.

HOLMES: Wearing greatcoats?

LESTRADE: Yes, Mr. Holmes, but why?

HOLMES: Good. They can hide their helmets and pretend to be singers. Come on. Let's go over there and, while we're walking, we'll rehearse our carols. We must appear reasonably convincing. (MERRILY) Sound your A, Lestrade, sound your A!

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... "GOOD KING WENCESLAS" / "LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN"

CHILDREN: (BUZZING AND LAUGHING HAPPILY)

LIONEL: Take me for a ride on your back, Santa Claus.

HUDSON: No, no, you mustn't make Santa Claus too tired, Lionel.

WATSON: No, that's all right, Mrs. Hudson. Hop on, Lionel, hop on!

CAROLERS: (SING "GOOD KING WENCESLAS" ... OFF)

ELSIE: Ooh, they're singing carols outside the door!

HUDSON: Oh, isn't that nice?

BERTIE: Can't they come inside and sing for us, Santa Claus?

WATSON: Yes, of course they can. Ask them to come in, Mrs. Hudson, will you?

HUDSON: (MOVING OFF) All right, sir.

ELSIE: (TO WATSON) Ooh, come on, let me get on your back, too!

WATSON: Oh, now, now -- take it easy. (LIFTS ELSIE UP, WITH EFFORT) Oooh, there we go!

CAROLERS: (APPROACH, STILL SINGING; DURING FOLLOWING, THEY FINISH THEIR SONG)

BERTIE: I want to see your reindeer, Santa.

WATSON: See my reindeer? Well, they're up on the roof.

BERTIE: I'll climb up and see 'em!

WATSON: No, no, no, you mustn't do that -- they're asleep! Oh, here are the carol singers. Off you get, children. (SETS CHILDREN DOWN, WITH EFFORT) There we go. That's it. Now-- (TO CAROLERS) Good evening, gentlemen!

LOU: Good evening, and merry Chrithmath.

WATSON: Would you like to sing some carols to the children? After that, I'm sure you'd like a drop of - (CHUCKLES) - something to warm you up.

LOU: Well, thank you, thir. We'd thure like that.

WATSON: Haven't I met you somewhere before, my man?

LOU: Er-- No, thir. I'm thure you haven't. (TO CAROLERS) Er, come on, men. Let'th thing "Good King Wenthethlath."

CAROLERS: (SING) "Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen--"

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... PICKS UP "GOOD KING WENCESLAS"

LESTRADE: Well, here we are outside the house, Mr. Holmes. Now what?

CAROLERS: (SINGING "GOOD KING WENCESLAS" OFF, FROM INSIDE OF HOUSE)

HOLMES: Sh-sh-sh! Listen. (BEAT) Uh huh. Lou the Lisper and his men are already there.

WIDECOMBE: Are we going in now?

HOLMES: In a moment. (TO COPPERS) Now, men -- you have your truncheons handy?

COPPER: Yes, Mr. Holmes, we're ready.

HOLMES: Splendid. Now, remember -- when we're inside and I yell "Merry Christmas" at the top of my voice, you bring out your truncheons and get Lou the Lisper and his gang out of there as quickly as possible. Don't arrest them until you get them outside again, Lestrade; I don't want to frighten the children.

LESTRADE: Right you are, Mr. Holmes. We're ready. Just give us the word and we'll go in and get 'em.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... "GOOD KING WENCESLAS"

WATSON: Ahhh, that was very nice singing! And now how about something to warm you all up?

LOU: That won't be nethethary, Dr. Watthon. (ASIDE, TO SAMMY) See to the door, Sammy. (TO PARTY GUESTS) Now, all of you thtay right where you are!

WATSON: Who are you? What do you think you're up to?

LOU: Pleathe don't be difficult, doctor. All I want is the jewelth out of my thack that you thtole from me tonight. You try and thtop me, I thall have to hurt you.

LIONEL: (GIGGLES) Why do you talk so funny? You got a cold like me?

LOU: Thut up! Now, doctor, where are the jewelth?

COPPERS: (SING "THE FIRST NOEL," OFF, BUT MOVING CLOSER) "No-el, noel--" (CONTINUES IN BG)

LOU: Oh, curtheth! There are thome more carol thingers outthide!

SOUND: KNOCK ON DOOR

SAMMY: Shall I tell 'em to go away, Lou?

LOU: No. Better let them come in. If we don't, they might get thuthpithiouth!

SAMMY: All right, Lou. I suppose you know what you're up to.

LOU: Now, no trickth, doctor. If you try and give an alarm, I thall have to get rough with you.

WATSON: Well, I don't mind about that, but just remember there are children present.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND COPPERS ENTER ... CAROLERS AND COPPERS MURMUR, IN BG

HOLMES: (DISGUISED VOICE, HEARTY) How are ye, matey? You were here before us, hey? Well, what d'you say we all join in a little carol for the nippers, hey?

LOU: (RELUCTANT) Well, all right. What - what do you want to thing?

HOLMES: (DISGUISED VOICE) How 'bout "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," eh?

LOU: All right, all right. (TO CAROLERS) Er, come on, men. Let'th thing.

CAROLERS & COPPERS: (SING) "Hark! The herald angels sing / Glory to the newborn king--"

HOLMES: (DISGUISED VOICE, LOUD) Merrrrry Christmas!

SOUND: CHAOTIC CACOPHONY! THE COPPERS CLOBBER THE CAROLERS AND DRAG THEM OUT THE DOOR WHILE THE CHILDREN LAUGH DELIGHTEDLY ... THEN IN BG

ELSIE: (LAUGHS) Look at 'em hitting each other on the head!

HUDSON: Dr. Watson! What's happening?! They're all hittin' each other with truncheons!

WATSON: (TO COPPERS) Here, you can't do that! (TO MRS. HUDSON) They're all going away. They're dragging each other out! (TO COPPERS) Hey! Hey, come back here!

HUDSON: Oh, this is terrible!

SOUND: CHAOS ENDS AS THE CAROLERS AND COPPERS EXIT ... CHILDREN BUZZ EXCITEDLY, THEN QUIET DOWN DURING FOLLOWING--

WATSON: (AMAZED) Holmes! Holmes, what in thunder's going on?!

HOLMES: I'll explain it to you later, old chap. (CALLS) Lestrade?!

LESTRADE: Yes, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Take them to Scotland Yard and prefer charges. I'll be over in a little while and give evidence.

LESTRADE: Right you are, sir. (CHUCKLES) Too bad we didn't catch Professor Moriarty, too.

HOLMES: Well, at least we have some of his cohorts. I'll see you later, Lestrade.

SOUND: DOOR SHUTS

WATSON: I wish I knew what was going on here. Is Moriarty mixed up in this business?

HOLMES: Yes, Watson, and I'll tell you all about it as soon as I've straightened this thing out. Oh, Widecombe?

WIDECOMBE: (OFF) Yes, Holmes?

HOLMES: The twenty-pound notes that you used as wrapping for your gifts seem to have been scattered all over the house. Uh, do you want me to recover them, too?

WIDECOMBE: No. From what you've told me of the children, I think their parents could use the money much more profitably than my relatives. In any case, I can replace it.

HOLMES: A very generous Christmas gift. Well, children -- did you enjoy the little game we staged for you?

LIONEL: It was a lot of fun.

BERTIE: Yes! I nearly died laughin' when they started hittin' each other!

CHILDREN: (LAUGH)

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) I'm glad you enjoyed it, children. And now I, er-- I want you to show me the presents you received.

ELSIE: I got these pretty earrings.

HOLMES: Oh, they were a part of the game, too! A nice little girl like you doesn't want silly earrings, Elsie. Here's a beautiful doll for you.

ELSIE: Coo! Her eyes open and shut and everything!

HOLMES: And what did you get, my little man?

BERTIE: These!

HOLMES: Oh, cufflinks! Good gracious, who wants cufflinks when he can have a - a clockwork train! You want to exchange?

BERTIE: Train? Lord love a duck, yes!

LIONEL: I wanted a dog.

WATSON: There's one for you, Lionel -- a nice woolly dog.

LIONEL: Oh, coo! He's lovely!

HOLMES: And here you are, children. Here's a nice big box of chocolates, too. You can all share them.

BERTIE: Oh, love me, what a night! I ain't had as much fun since Granny got her finger stuck in the plug-hole!

CHILDREN: (LAUGH)

WATSON: (LAUGHS) I - I still don't understand what's going on, Holmes, but I - I must say, this has all the earmarks of being a happy Christmas.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Yes, old fellow. Mrs. Hudson?

HUDSON: Aye, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: How's the turkey coming along?

HUDSON: Oh, it'll be ready in a few minutes, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Splendid. And, while we're waiting, perhaps the children will oblige with something we haven't heard so far this evening.

WATSON: Yes, yes, I know what you mean -- a Christmas carol that really sounds convincing. How 'bout it children?

MUSIC: ORGAN ... SNEAKS IN TO ACCOMPANY THE CAROL

BERTIE: All right, sir! Come on, Elsie! Come on, Lionel!

CHILDREN: (BEGIN TO SING THE FIRST STANZA OF "SILENT NIGHT")

MUSIC: THE ENTIRE CAST JOINS IN SINGING THE STANZA ... THEN SINGING AND ORGAN OUT

ANNOUNCER: Well, doctor, that was really a thwell-- A swell story. On a Christmas Eve like this, do you ever wish you were back in Baker Street celebrating Christmas there?

WATSON: At times, yes. But, actually, Mr. Bartell, I'm very happy right here in my little home. There, on the table, is a beautiful little Christmas tree. There's a fine fire in my fireplace. My two dogs, Monty and Willie, are sleeping peacefully at my feet. And, best of it all, I've got the love of every child in the neighborhood. Yes, I've got a great deal this Christmas Eve. Lots to be thankful for. And, what with the troubles of the world on their way to being settled, it looks as if this is the brightest Christmas that - that I've ever had.

ANNOUNCER: Well, that's how I feel about it, too, doctor.

WATSON: I hope that all our friends listening in are just as happy this Christmas Eve as we are. And speaking not only for myself but I know for all of us -- and for the Petri Family, too -- we wish every one of you a happy Christmas from the bottom of our hearts. God rest ye merry, - gentlemen.

ANNOUNCER: Well, Dr. Watson, next Monday is New Year's Eve. What story do you plan to tell us?

WATSON: One that I think you'll find extremely appropriate, Mr. Bartell. It takes place in a Scottish castle near Edinburgh on a New Year's Eve in Nineteen Hundred and concerns a pair of lovers, an elderly baronet, and a strange iron box that proved to be more than worth its weight in gold.

MUSIC: THEME ... THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: Tonight's Sherlock Holmes adventure was written by Denis Green and Anthony Boucher and was suggested by an incident in the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story, "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle." Music is by Dean Fosler. Mr. Rathbone appears through the courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Mr. Bruce through the courtesy of Universal Pictures where they are now starring in the Sherlock Holmes series.

The Petri Wine Company of San Francisco, California, invites you to tune in again next week, same time, same station. Sherlock Holmes comes to you from our Hollywood studios.

This is Harry Bartell, saying good night for the Petri Family!

MUSIC: OUT

ANNOUNCER: For a solid hour of exciting mystery dramas, listen every Monday on most of these same stations at eight o'clock to MICHAEL SHAYNE followed immediately by SHERLOCK HOLMES. This is the Mutual Broadcasting System.
ANNOUNCER: This episode from the life of Sherlock Holmes will be transmitted to our men and women overseas by shortwave and through the worldwide facilities of the Armed Forces Radio Service. Petri Wine brings you--

ANNOUNCER: --Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES!

MUSIC: FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN OUT

ANNOUNCER: The Petri family, the family that took time to bring you good wine, invite you to listen to Dr. Watson tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective, Sherlock Holmes. 

Well, this is it -- New Year's Eve -- and I wish you could be here with us this evening so we could toast each other with a glass of Petri California port. As you know, port wine has long been a favorite wine for celebrating a happy occasion. That's because port is a wine rich in tradition. And you couldn't ask for a more delicious port than Petri port. Petri port has a deep glowing red color, beautiful to look at and wonderful to taste, with a hearty full flavor that's right from the heart of the grape. And when you serve Petri port to your friends tonight, or - or any time, remember you can serve it proudly because the name Petri is the proudest name in the history of American wine.

MUSIC: THEME (Edward MacDowell's "Scotch Poem") ... FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

ANNOUNCER: And now I'm sure Dr. Watson's waiting for us, so let's drop in and see him. (TO WATSON) Good evening, doctor. 

WATSON: Good evening, Mr. Bartell. Draw up your usual chair.

ANNOUNCER: Thank you.

WATSON: Ah, that's it. Well, did you enjoy the Christmas holidays? 

ANNOUNCER: Well, I - I've had a whale of a time, thank you, but I don't think I can face a turkey or a mince pie for at least another year.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES WARMLY)

ANNOUNCER: How about you, doctor? 

WATSON: Oh, I had a very pleasant week, too, my boy -- parties, visitors, and a flattering number of Christmas messages to be answered.

ANNOUNCER: Oh, say, you've got a new pipe. Is that a Christmas present?

WATSON: Yes -- a new pipe, new tobacco pouch, and a pound of my favorite tobacco. All of them sent to me from London by an old client and a friend of mine, Sir Ian Dunbar. 

ANNOUNCER: An old client, huh? Well, do you mean he was one of your patients? Or was he someone that you and the great Sherlock Holmes helped?

WATSON: The latter, Mr. Bartell. As a matter of fact, it was receiving this gift that reminded me of the story I've decided to tell you tonight -- a story in which Sir Ian Dunbar played a prominent part. 

ANNOUNCER: And how did it begin? 

WATSON: The day before New Year's Eve in Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-Nine. Sherlock Holmes and I sat in opposite corners of a first-class railway carriage as we sped towards Edinburgh in the Flying Scotsman. 

ANNOUNCER: What took you and Sherlock Holmes up there, doctor? 

WATSON: It started off as a holiday visit, Mr. Bartell. My old friend Sir Walter Dunbar had asked Holmes and me to spend a few days with him at Dunbar Castle about twenty miles outside Edinburgh. After we left Kings Cross station, Holmes -- his sharp, eager face framed in his deer-stalking cap -- dipped into the bundle of fresh papers which he'd brought with him. We left Bedford far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under the seat, leaned across, and offered me his cigar case. (FADES OUT)

SOUND: MOVING TRAIN BACKGROUND ... WHISTLE BLOWS

HOLMES: Care for a cigar, Watson?

WATSON: No. No, thanks, old fellow; I'll stick to my pipe.

HOLMES: Flying Scotsman's living up to its name. We're going splendidly. Our present rate is fifty-three-and-a-half miles an hour.

WATSON: Oh? I hadn't noticed the quarter mile posts.

HOLMES: Nor have I, but the telegraph posts on this line are sixty yards apart. With the aid of a watch the calculation is a simple one. Watson, my dear fellow, we have several hours ahead of us. Tell me more about Sir Walter Dunbar. I have a feeling that he is in some kind of trouble, and that you haven't wanted to talk about it.

WATSON: Well, it's not exactly trouble, Holmes, but there's a strange problem that confronts the Dunbars. A problem that'll be settled at midnight tomorrow.

HOLMES: Oh, indeed? The night of New Year's Eve, eh?

WATSON: Yes, exactly. But to really appreciate the story, I have to begin by telling you of the death of old Sir Thomas Dunbar. 

HOLMES: The father of the present baronet, I suppose.

WATSON: Yes. He was severely wounded at Waterloo, though he managed to last long enough to get back to Dunbar Castle. The story goes that, as he lay there on his deathbed, he told his wife of his plans for their unborn son.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE FOR FLASHBACK ... SCENE FADES IN

WIFE: (WEEPS ... THEN IN BG)

THOMAS: There. Dinna grieve, lass. I fetched the baronetcy home from Waterloo, but I fetched a mortal wound as well. (BEAT) Aw, hush, lass. I'm not afraid to die. All that niggles me is that I shall ne'er see the child you bear. Is Sir Walter Scott not comin' yet? Eh, can't he be here at the deathbed of his old friend? (UP) Who's there? Is that you, Sandy Murdock?

SANDY: Aye, Thomas. It's me.

THOMAS: Aye. I'm leavin' an unborn son behind me when I die. Now, I don't trust women, little children, nor banks, for that matter. I put the best part of my wealth and gold in the big iron box ye'll find under the bed. The money's there. Aye, and something else for a rainy day. You'll have to keep that box in trust for me, Sandy. You can turn it over to my boy on the New Year's Eve before his 21st birthday -- when he'll be a man and wise enough to know how to use it. You understand, Sandy?

SANDY: Aye, Thomas. But supposing your baron's a girl?

THOMAS: A girl? I tell ye, it'll be a boy! (HIS DYING WORDS, SLOWLY) And we'll name him Walter after my good friend Sir Walter Scott. 

WIFE: (WEEPING UP TO FILL A PAUSE ... THEN CROSSFADES WITH--)

SOUND: MOVING TRAIN BACKGROUND

HOLMES: Very interesting story, Watson. And that child, of course, is the gentleman we are going to see now, Sir Walter Dunbar.

WATSON: Exactly.

HOLMES: And the first baronet was a friend of Sir Walter Scott, while his son can boast of your acquaintance. (DRY) Why, it's a family singularly rich in literary friendships.

WATSON: That's not very funny, Holmes. But to continue, I suppose you can guess what happened. Sir Thomas carefully drew up the document to specify the New Year's Eve before the baronet's 21st birthday. And the poor child was born on February the 29th. (CHUCKLES) It was a leap year.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) So poor Sir Walter is still waiting for his iron box full of gold.

WATSON: Yes. He'll be eighty-four next year and yet, legally, with only one birthday every four years -- in the eyes of the law -- he'll at last be twenty-one!

HOLMES: A most amusing situation, though I'm afraid Sir Walter finds it far from entertaining. The lawyers must have been extremely scrupulous in abiding by the letter of the document.

WATSON: Yes. Old Sandy Murdock is dead now, of course, but he too has a great-grandson, William Murdock, who still handles the Dunbar estate. He'll be at the castle tonight to formally hand over the iron box.

HOLMES: I'm delighted you accepted the holiday invitation of Sir Walter, my dear fellow. I've needed a rest, but I've always loathed too strict a one. This situation may pose a nice little problem for me.

WATSON: Problem?

HOLMES: Yes, I'm reasonably certain that the agèd Sir Walter Dunbar will not get his iron box full of gold on this New Year's Eve, either. But we shall see, old fellow; we shall see.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... WITH A SCOTS FLAVOR

IAN: Dr. Watson! I'm glad to see you and Mr. Holmes here at the castle.

WATSON: Thank you, my boy. Holmes, this is Ian Dunbar, Sir Walter's grandson.

HOLMES: How do you do, Mr. Dunbar?

IAN: I'm very proud to meet you, Mr. Holmes. I've heard a lot about you. My grandfather will be down in a few moments. Let's go into the library, shall we?

SOUND: THEIR STEPS INTO LIBRARY ... IN BG

WATSON: I imagine Sir Walter's quite excited about tonight's ceremony, isn't he?

IAN: (CHUCKLES) Wouldn't you be if you'd waited sixty-three years too long for an inheritance?

WATSON: (CHUCKLES) 

IAN: Thank the Lord I had the foresight to be born on the prosaic date of August the twenty-first.

HOLMES: In the event of your grandfather's death, you would be the next baronet, I take it?

IAN: Yes, Mr. Holmes. (SOBERLY) You see, my father was killed two months ago at Mafeking.

WATSON: (MATCHES HIM) Yes-yes, I read about it in the papers, my boy. I'm - I'm very sorry.

IAN: Thank you, doctor. (CHANGES SUBJECT, LIGHTLY) The opening of the box isn't going to be the only ceremony at midnight. Dorothy and I are announcing our engagement.

WATSON: Er, Dorothy?

IAN: Dorothy Small. She and her father are staying here, too.

HOLMES: My congratulations.

WATSON: Yes-yes, indeed, Ian, indeed. Mine, too.

IAN: Thank you. It's been quite a battle with her father, though. He's a business man and isn't impressed with titles when they aren't accompanied by a suitable income. But when we told him about the inheritance, he relented and gave his consent.

SOUND: LIBRARY DOOR OPENS ... STEPS IN

IAN: Ah, here's Dorothy now.

SOUND: LIBRARY DOOR CLOSES ... STEPS OUT BEHIND--

IAN: Dorothy darling, I want you to meet two friends of mine, Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

DOROTHY: How do you do?

HOLMES: How do you do, Miss Small?

WATSON: How are you, my dear? From what this young man's been telling us, I gather that congratulations are in order.

DOROTHY: Thank you. I finally persuaded father that Ian would make a worthy son-in-law. For a while I was afraid we'd have to elope to Gretna Green and live in a cottage on bread and cheese and love, and "brave the parental wrath," just as they do in the story books.

SOUND: LIBRARY DOOR OPENS ... WALTER AND HERBERT'S STEPS IN

WATSON: Oh, Sir Walter, there you are!

SOUND: LIBRARY DOOR CLOSES ... WALTER AND HERBERT'S STEPS TO WATSON

WALTER: Watson, me dear boy! How are ye? And this must be your friend, Sherlock Holmes.

HOLMES: How do you do, Sir Walter?

WALTER: Very well, for a young nipper who'll be twenty-one at midnight. (CHUCKLES) Oh, gentlemen, may I introduce Mr. Herbert Small?

HOLMES: How do you do?

WATSON: How do you do, sir? I believe we have to congratulate you on the engagement of your daughter.

HERBERT: (IRRITATED) That was supposed to remain a secret until midnight, when the Dunbar box was finally opened.

WALTER: Ah, don'na be grouchy, Herbert. The children are in love, and I'm going to settle money on Ian. And it's New Year's Eve! Let's enter into the spirit of the occasion. Bring out the glasses, Ian. I've had some bottles of my special pride put out; it's the finest port in Scotland -- the Creme of Dunbar. Aye, my father laid the first bottle down the year before I was born. And a drink of the brew will surely warm the cockles of your heart.

SOUND: OF DRINKS BEING FIXED, IN BG

WATSON: Well, my mouth's watering already, Sir Walter.

HERBERT: When is this lawyer fellow, young Murdock, getting here?

WALTER: Oh, any moment, Herbert. As soon as he arrives we'll have dinner and then we'll be ready for the evening's ceremonies.

HOLMES: He's bringing the famous iron box with him, Sir Walter?

WALTER: If he doesn't, he won't get any dinner, Holmes! Ian, pass the glasses around, me boy.

SOUND: LIBRARY DOOR OPENS ... MURDOCK'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES BEHIND--

WALTER: Ah, there you are, Murdock!

MURDOCK: Good evening, Sir Walter.

WALTER: Oh, ye've got the box with ye, I see. Now the party's complete! Oh, let me introduce you. (BRISK INTRODUCTIONS) Miss Small; her father, Mr. Small; my grandson Ian you know; Mr. Sherlock Holmes; Dr. Watson.

WATSON: How do you do?

MURDOCK: I'm sorry I'm late, Sir Walter. My train was delayed.

WALTER: Oh, that's all right, Murdock. You're here and you brought the box. That's all that matters. Ian, give our young lawyer a drink. (MOVING OFF) Here, I'll help you pour.

SOUND: GUESTS MURMUR, IN BG, AS HOLMES AND WATSON CHAT QUIETLY

WATSON: I must say that this is rather exciting, Holmes. The famous iron box with its inheritance of gold.

HOLMES: Yes, and from the size of the box, at a rough guess, I should estimate its cubic content in gold at around five thousand pounds. Not a vast sum, perhaps, to a business man like Mr. Small, but a windfall to an impecunious Scottish baronet.

WATSON: Yes, I suppose it is.

HOLMES: A strong young man, Mr. Murdock.

WATSON: How do you mean "strong," Holmes?

HOLMES: A box that size full of golden sovereigns would weigh a considerable amount, and yet the lawyer carried it single-handed.

SOUND: GUESTS QUIET BEHIND--

WALTER: (TO ALL) Now that we're all assembled, I am going to propose a toast. Though it is still some hours off yet, let's drink to the New Year. That means a lot to some of us. To Nineteen Hundred!

SOUND: GLASSES CLINK! AND GUESTS MURMUR "TO 1900!"

DOROTHY: We should toast more than just Nineteen Hundred, Sir Walter. We should drink to the new century that's about to begin.

IAN: Good idea, Dorothy.

WATSON: Oh, I'm afraid that wouldn't be quite appropriate, Miss Small. To be accurate, the 20th century won't begin until January the first, Nineteen Hundred and One, and not Nineteen Hundred.

HERBERT: (REALIZES, PLEASED) Of course! That's it! Dorothy, I'm afraid your wedding can't take place for some time yet.

DOROTHY: Father, what are you talking about?

HERBERT: I read an article in the Guardian the other day that said just the same thing as you, Dr. Watson. And what's more, it said something even more important. It said that Nineteen Hundred is not a leap year!

WALTER: Aw, rubbish! Leap year comes every four years. There was one in Eighteen and Ninety-Six; then obviously Nineteen Hundred is one!

IAN: I think Mr. Small may be right. What do you say, Mr. Holmes, do you know?

HOLMES: Well, I hoped no one would bring up this point, but-- Heh! It's the little problem I referred to on the train, my dear Watson.

WATSON: Yes, I remember.

WALTER: Holmes! For Heavens sake, answer! Is Nineteen Hundred a leap year or no?

HOLMES: I'm afraid it's not, Sir Walter.

WALTER: No?

SOUND: GUESTS MURMUR BRIEFLY

HOLMES: Because of a slight imbalance that would otherwise be produced in the calendar. Of the even century years, only those divisible by four hundred are leap years. In other words, Sixteen Hundred was a leap year, the year Two Thousand will be a leap year, but Eighteen Hundred and Nineteen Hundred are not leap years.

MURDOCK: (REALIZES, RELIEVED) Then you have no birthday next year, Sir Walter, and I'm afraid I can't open the box tonight.

DOROTHY: (REALIZES, UNHAPPY) And the Dunbars won't get their inheritance!

HERBERT: (TRIUMPHANT) And you, my dear, don't marry for a few more years. I won't allow you to marry a pauper!

IAN: Mr. Holmes, are you sure of your facts?

HOLMES: I'm very much afraid that I am, young man.

WALTER: (GROANS) This is terrible. I canna stand any more!

WATSON: Now, now, now -- don't take it too badly, Sir Walter. Here, here's a-- Here, drink this.

WALTER: (DRINKS, EXHALES)

WATSON: That's it. After all, you only have to wait another four years.

WALTER: Another four years?! At my age, young man? At my age?! Oh no, I shall never live that long.

SOUND: LIBRARY DOOR OPENS

WALTER: Aye? What is it, Angus?

ANGUS: (OFF) Dinner is prepared, Sir Walter. We can serve it as soon as you're ready, sir.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

WATSON: Oh, what a miserable meal, Holmes. Sir Walter's gone to his room, the young lovers are nearly in tears, and Small and the lawyer Murdock seem to be positively gloating.

HOLMES: Yes, a most depressing atmosphere in which to welcome the new year. But let us, at least, make the best of it. I think I'll go and have a talk with Sir Walter. And you, my dear chap, why not try and cheer up the young folks? (MOVING OFF) Some of your experiences in India may help them take their minds off their troubles.

WATSON: Yes. Quite an idea. I'll join you in the library. Call me if you want me, Holmes.

SOUND: LIVING ROOM DOOR OPENS ... WATSON'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES

WATSON: Ah! There you are, my dears.

DOROTHY: Hello, Dr. Watson.

WATSON: All alone in the front of the fire, eh?

IAN: I'm afraid we're not in very good spirits.

WATSON: Oh, nevertheless I'll sit down here and join you, if you don't mind. Misery loves company, you know? (CHUCKLES)

DOROTHY: You're so very kind, doctor.

WATSON: Oh, not at all.

DOROTHY: I was just trying to persuade Ian to elope with me, but he's being most ungallant; he won't even consider it.

IAN: How can I, darling? I've got under 200 pounds a year in my own right. How could we live on that? I was counting on the money that grandfather was going to give us to get me started.

WATSON: (WARMLY REASSURING) Now-now-now-now. Miss Small, a little earlier you talked of Gretna Green, and bread and cheese, and love in a cottage. Yes, there's a lot to be said for it, you know? 

IAN: Ah, to be said for it, yes, doctor. But have you ever tried it? 

WATSON: Not literally, my boy. But I must tell you that when Mary, my wife, and I were first married I had very little money. In fact, my income was just about the sum that you mentioned. And we were very happy.

IAN: Ah, but you have a profession, doctor. Look at me, I've been trained for nothing except to be lord of Dunbar Castle. I can't support the wife on tradition. 

DOROTHY: But you're young, Ian. You can get some kind of position; I'm sure you can.

WATSON: Yes, of course, of course. As a matter of fact, I think that--

SOUND: LIVING ROOM DOOR OPENS

WATSON: (TENSE) Holmes? What is it? What's wrong?

HOLMES: (BRISK, URGENT) The devil's work afoot, Watson. Come with me, old fellow; and you, Mr. Dunbar. 

DOROTHY: Mr. Holmes, what's happened?

HOLMES: (RAPIDLY) It's Sir Walter. I went to his room. It was in darkness, but in the moonlight I saw two figures struggling by the open casement. One of them was Sir Walter. As I entered he disappeared from sight. His attacker had pushed him out of the window into the moat.

DOROTHY: How dreadful! 

HOLMES: The other man got away in the darkness. We must get lanterns and go out to the moat at once. Though I'm very much afraid, Mr. Dunbar, that your grandfather is beyond our help!

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: Dr. Watson will be back in just a second, so I'd just like to remind you that if you want to serve a wine over the holidays that you're sure the ladies will enjoy, serve Petri California Muscatel. Petri Muscatel is a golden wine with a wonderful flavor -- the flavor of big plump Muscat grapes -- and you know what a flavor that is. I'm sure you'll find that Petri Muscatel is the favorite wine of all women just as Petri port is the favorite wine with men. And incidentally if you're not sure which to get -- Petri Muscatel or Petri port -- don't buy one. Buy two. Get them both and you'll be sure to please everyone. (BEAT) Now to get back to our story. Someone had pushed poor old Sir Walter out of his bedroom window and into the moat below, isn't that right, Dr. Watson? 

WATSON: Yes, Mr. Bartell. Of course we grabbed lanterns as fast as we could and rushed outside, but it was a hopeless task. The water was eight or ten feet deep, and it seemed obvious that the elderly Sir Walter wouldn't have had a chance of saving himself. But we searched on -- the thick of bobbing lanterns and the scurrying figures in the frosty moonlight forming a weird, fantastic scene. (FADES OUT)

SOUND: NOCTURNAL BACKGROUND (FROGS, CRICKETS, ET CETERA) ... SLOSH OF MOAT WATER

IAN: (OFF, CALLS) Angus! Bring a lantern over here!

ANGUS: (OFF) Aye, sir!

IAN: (OFF) Can you see anything, Holmes?

HOLMES: (OFF) Not a thing.

HERBERT: I don't see why your friend doesn't call the police, Dr. Watson. We're accomplishing nothing. 

WATSON: He thought there might be a chance of finding the old man alive, Mr. Small. He wants to avoid a scandal, if possible -- for your sake, sir, as well as the Dunbars. 

HERBERT: A scandal can't touch me, or Dorothy, over this. Her engagement was never announced, thank heaven. 

WATSON: That's a great pity, sir. I should think some new blood in your family would be a great improvement. 

HERBERT: You're being confoundedly impertinent, doctor! 

WATSON: And you're being confoundedly heartless, sir. 

SOUND: SLOSH OF WATER HAS STOPPED DURING ABOVE ... FIRST HOLMES' AND THEN IAN'S STEPS APPROACH IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

WATSON: Well, Holmes? Have - have you given up hope?

HOLMES: (APPROACHES) I'm afraid we'll never find him without dragnets and grappling hooks. Have to call the police. What time is it? (NO ANSWER, CALLS) Sir Ian? Do you know the time?

IAN: (APPROACHES) What did you call me, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Sir Ian.

WATSON: (REALIZES) By Jove, yes! It does seem a bit premature, Holmes, but of course you're right! If your poor grandfather's dead, Mr. Dunbar, you're the baronet now!

HOLMES: (POINTEDLY) And the time, Sir Ian?

IAN: It's - it's a quarter to twelve, Mr. Holmes. 

HOLMES: (PLEASED) A quarter of an hour to the new year. Sir Ian, doesn't that fact suggest something to you?

IAN: (REALIZES) Yes! Yes, it does. So I'm the new baronet, am I? Very well then. (DELIBERATELY) There'll be no more talk of the police for fifteen minutes. I want all of you to come back to the castle with me. As the last chime of midnight rings out, I shall have a statement to make. A statement that I want you all to hear.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: MURMUR OF GUESTS ... THEN IN BG, AS HOLMES AND WATSON CHAT

WATSON: What's he brought us all back here for, Holmes? Something very funny going on. I tell you, I don't like the look of it. 

HOLMES: And I, Watson, like the look of it very much. 

WATSON: I wish you wouldn't be so dashed mysterious. What are you up to? You haven't taken a step yet towards finding the murderer.

HOLMES: Haven't I? [X] And I wonder what causes the beads of perspiration on Mr. Small's brow.

WATSON: Small? You mean that Small--?

HOLMES: And I wonder what causes the singular look of apprehension on the face of Murdock, the young lawyer. You remember, of course, on my remarking how easily he carried the large iron box.

WATSON: (REALIZES) Great Scott, yes. And it took a strong man to throw Sir Walter out of the window!

HOLMES: Ssh, Watson. 

WATSON: Huh?

HOLMES: The new year is approaching. 

SOUND: CLOCK STARTS CHIMING MIDNIGHT ABOVE AT [X] ... NOW FINISHES CHIMING ... GUESTS GROW QUIET

IAN: (TO ALL) Ladies and gentlemen, in view of our recent tragedy, this is one New Year's Eve when none of us feels like song and jollity. But there still remains a ritual duty for me to perform. Mr. Murdock, open the iron box please.

MURDOCK: But-- But-- But I can't do that. It was only to be opened for your grandfather.

IAN: No, Mr. Murdock. The phrase was that it was to be opened on "the New Year's Eve before the baronet's 21st birthday." I am now the baronet, and I shall be twenty-one next year on August 21st. Open the box please, Mr. Murdock.

DOROTHY: Ian darling, how frightfully clever of you.

HOLMES: Good lad. I'd hoped he'd think of it.

MURDOCK: But, Sir Ian-- 

IAN: Murdock, open that box. 

MURDOCK: Very well, Sir Ian. But I'm afraid you're in for something of a shock.

SOUND: BOX UNLOCKED ... CREAKS OPEN SLOWLY

WATSON: Great Scott! The - the box is empty.

SOUND: GUESTS MURMUR BRIEFLY IN SURPRISE

HOLMES: Except for a sheet of notepaper in the bottom.

IAN: What's the meaning of this, Murdock? 

MURDOCK: Read that paper, Sir Ian, and you'll understand.

SOUND: RATTLE OF PAPER 

IAN: (READS, SLOWLY) "I.O.U. - four thousand sovereign." (BRISKLY) And it's signed, "Alexander Murdock, on behalf of Murdock and Murdock, lawyers." You'd better explain this.

MURDOCK: It's the family skeleton, Sir Ian. That note is signed by my great-grandfather, the one that witnessed the original deed concerning the box. As soon as Sir Walter was born on that February the 29th, my great-grandfather realized the money wouldn't have to be produced for eighty-four years.

IAN: And so he stole it! 

MURDOCK: He borrowed it! He always intended to pay it back, but he was never able to. When he died he told my father of his secret; and my father in turn told me. We've always planned to put back the money, Sir Ian, but we've never been able to. 

HERBERT: This is daylight robbery! You should prosecute them, Ian! The firm's still in business! You can ruin them! You can sue them for every penny they have!

IAN: Mr. Small, you've already shown a marked aversion to my family. I suggest you allow me to handle their affairs.

DOROTHY: Bravo, Ian!

HERBERT: How dare you, Dorothy? Go to your room!

IAN: No one's going to their room. No one's leaving here until the police arrive. I'm convinced that one of you murdered my grandfather tonight.

WATSON: And if you ask me, it's obvious who that someone is.

MURDOCK: Who, Dr. Watson?

WATSON: You, Mr. Murdock. You came here planning to kill poor old Sir Walter because you never intended to open that box. You thought that your secret would die with him.

MURDOCK: That's a lie! I was going to tell him everything and then ask for time to pay the money. I didn't kill him.

HERBERT: Of course he didn't! There's your murderer! You yourself, Ian.

DOROTHY: Father, what are you saying?

HERBERT: I'm saying that Ian's the murderer. He saw that the box wasn't going to be open for another four years. He realized that without the money he couldn't marry Dorothy, so he killed his grandfather and then ordered the box opened. 

IAN: You're trying to cover yourself! You pushed grandfather out of that window tonight. You thought that if he died, the box would never be opened, so Dorothy couldn't marry me! 

HERBERT: (SPUTTERS WITH ANGER) You--! You--!

HOLMES: (CALM) Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

WATSON: Upon my soul, Holmes. You seem remarkably calm. 

HOLMES: Do I, my dear Watson? I must say, I am absolutely fascinated by listening to three people accusing each other of murder -- and each of them producing perfectly sound motives. It's a remarkable example of the dangers of reasoning from motive alone. We should profit by experience, Watson. 

DOROTHY: Mr. Holmes, how can you be so calm? There's a murderer in this room!

HOLMES: I suppose this game of charades is getting a little out of hand, Miss Small. Let's conclude it. (CALLS) You'd better come out now!

SOUND: TAPESTRY DRAWN BACK ON CURTAIN ROD

DOROTHY: (GASPS) That tapestry! It's moving!

SOUND: WALTER'S STEPS IN

WALTER: A happy New Year to ye all!

IAN: (SURPRISED) Grandfather!

WATSON: Sir Walter! Or am I seeing a ghost?

DOROTHY: (RELIEVED) Oh, Sir Walter, you're all right!

HERBERT: What kind of a game have you been playing? 

WALTER: 'Tis a bonny game that Holmes and I invented. You might call it "Forcing the Issue." I was determined to have the box open before the next four years were out, whilst I was still alive to look inside it. But the trickery of your family, Murdock, has made me a very unhappy man.

MURDOCK: Sir Walter, I shall pay back the money in a few years, I swear I will! 

WALTER: It'll be too late to do me any good, but I'll take care that Ian gets it. I have half a mind to prosecute ye!

IAN: (WARMLY) Grandfather, the money isn't important now that you're all right.

WALTER: Ah, you were counting on it just the same, my boy, so that you could marry Dorothy. I know that.

HERBERT: Ah, she'll never marry a pauper! I won't allow it!

DOROTHY: When I'm twenty-one you can't stop me, father -- and I am going to marry Ian. 

HERBERT: Be quiet! (TO WALTER) Sir Walter?! It's a very unsavory business! I think that you owe us an explanation of your behavior tonight.

WALTER: You tell him, Holmes. I fancy a wee drop of Creme of Dunbar. Watching you all search for my body in the moat has made me thirsty!

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) The explanation is a very simple one, ladies and gentlemen. When you arrived here tonight, Mr. Murdock, I knew from the way you handled the box that it could not contain the sum of gold it was supposed to.

WATSON: And so you - you suspected fraud and devised a plan to force the opening of the box, eh?

HOLMES: Yes, and Sir Walter was an eager conspirator. 

WALTER: Of course I was! Ian is twenty-one next August. Supposing - supposing I had died off ere he came of age and before my next birthday four years hence. The box would never have been opened.

HOLMES: And so we invented the fake murder story. By the way, Ian, I must congratulate you for grasping the possibilities of the situation so speedily. If you hadn't demanded the opening of the box, the Murdock secret might still be a secret. 

WATSON: Hm, it was a clever plan, Holmes. Too bad that it had to have such a miserable ending. 

HOLMES: I'm not sure that we have finished with the matter. Mr. Murdock?

MURDOCK: Yes, Mr. Holmes? 

HOLMES: You say that your family took four thousand pounds from that box?

MURDOCK: Yes, Mr. Holmes. 

HOLMES: Curious. I would have sworn from its size that it would hold closer to five thousand. And in your account of the legend, Watson, you told me that Sir Thomas Dunbar stated on his deathbed that he had put something else in the box.

WATSON: Yes, yes, yes.

HOLMES: Something for a rainy day, is that it?

WATSON: Yes. Mm-hmm. 

HOLMES: Did the Murdocks find that extra something?

MURDOCK: No, Mr. Holmes. They found nothing but the gold. 

HOLMES: Now that's very odd. (MOVING OFF) I think I'll take a closer look at that box, if you don't mind.

SOUND: HOLMES' STEPS AWAY TO BOX

DOROTHY: Since this seems to be a night of telling secrets, I think you might as well know, father, that if you don't give your consent, I shall elope with Ian.

WATSON: Oh, bravo, my dear, bravo!

HERBERT: You'll do no such thing!

SOUND: HOLMES' STEPS RETURN

HOLMES: (APPROACHES) I admire your resolution, young lady, but I hardly think it will be necessary.

WATSON: What do you mean, Holmes? 

HOLMES: Permit me to show you all the treasure of the Dunbars. 

WALTER: What have you found, Holmes?

HOLMES: The "something for a rainy day" that old Sir Thomas spoke of. You see, since the
cubic contents of the box obviously differed from my calculations, I deduced the existence of a false bottom. I was correct. And in that space I found -- this!

SOUND: MANUSCRIPT PLACED ON TABLE

WATSON: A manuscript? 

HOLMES: Quite so. The manuscript of a book. Look at the title page and see the author's name.

WATSON: (READS) "History of the Dunbar Family--" (SHOCKED) "By Sir Walter Scott"?!

SOUND: ALL BUT HOLMES AND WATSON GASP AND MURMUR WITH SURPRISE

HOLMES: I think, Sir Walter, that an original and unpublished manuscript by your distinguished namesake will prove worth several times the gold that is missing from that box. 

WALTER: You've saved the day for us, Holmes my boy! God bless ye! Ach! Oh, this has been as strange a new year as ever I knew, but it's turned out to be a bonny one, thanks to you, Holmes. (TO ALL) Well, fill up your glasses! We're going to drink a toast to the new year! 

WATSON: By Jove, yes, Sir Walter! This is really a happy occasion. 

HOLMES: Then let's complete it -- by singing the traditional song of the season, "Auld Lang Syne." And in this case, when we sing "Should auld acquaintance be forgot," I feel that in, our hearts, we should be thinking of Sir Walter Scott. Though he died over sixty years ago, he's made us all very happy here tonight.

ANNOUNCER: Well, doctor, that turned out to be a very happy New Year for all concerned. 

WATSON: Yes, that's one New Year that I'll never forget. 

ANNOUNCER: Well, I sure hope you'll always remember this one, too.

WATSON: Oh, just a second, my boy. That calls for a glass of port!

ANNOUNCER: Fine.

SOUND: BOTTLE ON GLASS ... WINE POURED

WATSON: Well, to a-- To a happy new year, my boy -- for you, and for our many friends listening in. 

ANNOUNCER: And to you, doctor.

WATSON: Thanks, my boy.

SOUND: GLASSES CLINK AND THEY DRINK

ANNOUNCER: Ahhhh, that's good. Doctor, this has indeed been a pleasant association for me.

WATSON: Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

ANNOUNCER: You're the best storyteller I've ever known and the Petri family makes the best wine I've ever tasted.

WATSON: Oh, really? (CHUCKLES)

ANNOUNCER: I hope that, just as they've been making wine for generations in the past, the Petri family will continue to make fine wine in the future. 

WATSON: Well, Mr. Bartell, I know that you will always be here to tell us just how good that Petri wine is! (CHUCKLES)

ANNOUNCER: Well, I hope so, doctor. And I hope you'll always be right here beside me to tell another swell story about Mr. Holmes.

WATSON: Well, I hope so, too, my boy.

ANNOUNCER: Oh, and incidentally, doctor -- what new adventure are you planning to tell us next week?

WATSON: Next week, Mr. Bartell, I'm going to tell you a weird story. It starts with a series of murders on Hampstead Heath -- and ends with a battle to the death in a burning waxworks. I call it "The Strange Case of the Murderer in Wax."

MUSIC UP AND UNDER

ANNOUNCER: Now once again it's time to keep that weekly appointment with our good friend and host, Dr. Watson. Good evening, Dr. Watson.

WATSON: Good evening, Mr. Bell. As usual you're punctual to the minute. Pull up a chair and make yourself comfortable.

BELL: Thank you. 

WATSON: That's it. 

BELL: I see that you have the old black, tin dispatch box out again, Dr. Watson. I deduce that you were going over your notes on tonight's case.

WATSON: Elementary my, dear boy. Among the records I came across some notes of some cases that I'd almost forgotten. The shocking death of Crosby the banker, the Adeltine tragedy, and some darter on the unusual contents of the ancient British pharaoh.

BELL: Those stories sound pretty intriguing, Dr. Watson. 

WATSON: I shall tell them to you some other evening, Mr. Bell. Tonight, I'm going to recount an adventure that took place in the heart of the beautiful English countryside. I call it, "The Adventure of the Tolling Bell." (NARRATING) Well that story began in a small country village of Conforth. Holmes had recently brought to a successful conclusion the affair of the Barrow and Furnace Wheelchair Murders. And we decided a few days rest in nearby Conforth would do us good before returning to our arduous life on Baker Street. We were staying in a small, but comfortable Inn. Only on the morning of the third day, I remember, Holmes and I were in our bedroom waiting for those two essentials without which an English country gentleman could not start his day -- an early morning cup of tea and a jug of hot water for shaving. As we sat there at the open window a nearby church bell was tolling a funeral nell. 

F/X: Bell tolling in distance

WATSON: There must be a funeral in the village, Holmes.

HOLMES: An astonishing deduction, Watson.

WATSON: There's no need to make fun of me. Impressing sound isn't it?

HOLMES: I suppose so. Has it ever occurred to you Watson that the history of bells is full of romantic interest?

WATSON: Well, I can't say that I've thought much about it.

HOLMES: Almost every historical event has been accompanied by the sound of bells. They summon soldiers to arms, as well as Christians to church. They sounded the alarm in 5 ? 2 Multan invasion. And many a bloody chapter in history has been rung in and out by bells.

WATSON: Well, you seem to be a mind of information on the subject.

HOLMES: Yes, Watson. It's a fascinating subject.

F/X: KNOCK at DOOR

WATSON: Come in, come in. Good morning, my dear.

MARY: (obvious upset about something) Pardon me, gentlemen, I brought your tea and your shaving water. Mrs. Michol said to say your breakfast will be ready in half an hour.

WATSON: Splendid, Marian. Oh, ah, Mary, the church bell is tolling a funeral nell. Do you know who's being buried?

MARY: (on the verge of tears) That I do, sir. I wish it was me. It will be my turn soon.

F/X: Door CLOSES

WATSON: Poor little thing. I wonder what's the matter with her?

HOLMES: I have no idea.

WATSON: Perhaps her father or mother just died. Or a young man, yes, I bet that's it. She's a pretty girl. She'd obviously been crying when she came in. Perhaps that's her fianc? they're burying now.

HOLMES: Watson, you have the sentimental imagination of the true storyteller. But we've come here for a holiday. You must give your imagination a rest, too. So, drink your tea, remove your whiskers, and we'll go downstairs and investigate those kippers.

MUSIC UP AND OUT

F/X: CUPS, SAUCERS and general BREAKFAST NOISES under the following.

MRS. MICHOL: You like your kippers, gentlemen?

WATSON: Excellent, Mrs. Michol, excellent. Never eaten better.

HOLMES: Yes, indeed. By the way, Mrs. Michol, we heard the funeral bell tolling earlier on. Do you know who was being buried?

MRS. MICHOL: Yes, I do. Two souls were being buried. And one of them was a murderer.

WATSON: A murderer? Lord, in this peaceful village.

HOLMES: What happened, Mrs. Michol?

MRS. MICHOL: Old Threadgold the corn merchant found out his wife had been gallivanting around with a young fellow from Bolton. Cut her throat, he did, and then hanged himself. More tea?

HOLMES: Thank you. 

WATSON: Shocking! So the peaceful countryside is not as peaceful as it's made out to be, Holmes.

HOLMES: Thank that I frequently had occasion to point out to you, Watson. Has the morning post arrived yet, Mrs. Michol?

MRS. MICHOL: Here comes ol' Gilly up the path with it now. I'll see if he's got anything for you.

WATSON: A murder. What do you make of it, Holmes?

HOLMES: What is there to make of it, Watson? A jealous husband murders a faithfuless wife and then commits suicide. A tragic story, but a simple one.

GILLIAN: Top of the morning to you, gentlemen.

HOLMES: Good morning, Gillian. Any letters for me today?

GILLIAN: Aye, Mr. Holmes, two letters. One of them's got some newspaper clippings in it I think. And you got a postcard from a Mr. Lestrade, he wants you back in London bad Mr. Holmes. There you are. 

WATSON: Pardon myself, Gilly, you've been reading Mr. Holmes private correspondence.

GILLIAN: Bless your heart, Dr. Watson. If I didn't read other people's correspondence, how would I know what's going on in the village?

HOLMES: Hmm, you were right, Gilly, it is newspaper clippings. And by the way, you heard about the murder of Mrs. Threadgold, I suppose?

GILLIAN: Heard about it? I tolled the bell this morning at the funeral.

WATSON: Did you say that you're the bell ringer as well as the postman?

GILLIAN: Bless your heart, yes, Doctor. President of the Choral Society, too, as well as being on the Perries council.

HOLMES: You're a busy man, Gillian.

GILLIAN: That I am, sir. Take this afternoon now. I'm to ring those bells again.

WATSON: Not another funeral, surely?

GILLIAN: No, sir. A wedding this time.

WATSON: Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

GILLIAN: Young Saint Perry is marrying the Slater girl. And you might say I'm responsible for bringing them together. Got some of their letters mixed up I did. They looked each other up to exchange them, and, presto, before you know what's happening, they're getting married. Regular cupid you might say I am.

MRS. MICHOL: Be off with you, Gilly. Other people want their letters. Mr. Holmes doesn't want his kippers spoiled with your idle chatter.

GILLIAN: All right, Mrs. Crab-Apples-and-Vinegar. 

MRS. MICHOL: Ahh.

GILLIAN: One of these fine days you'll smile, and the world will come to an end. Good day, gentlemen.

MRS. MICHOL: Talkative ol' busybody he is. Oh, Mr. Holmes, Mrs. Lakland's in the hall. The poor old lady is most anxious to talk to you.

HOLMES: Mrs. Lakland?

MRS. MICHOL: She has the seamstress shop on the high street. Her only son ran away from home a few months back. I think that's what she wants to speak to you about.

WATSON: Oh, but my friend's here for a rest, Mrs. Michol.

MRS. MICHOL: I told her that Dr, but she won't go away without seeing Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Oh, very well. Ask her to come in, please, Mrs. Michol.

MRS. MICHOL: Yes, Mr. Holmes.

WATSON: Oh, I do bother to see her, Holmes. Sounds like a trivial matter. 

HOLMES: The disappearance of an only son can never be a trivial matter.

WATSON: Well, I meant trivial for you, not for her.

MICHOL: This is Mr. Holmes, and Doctor Watson, dear.

MRS. LAKLAND: Thank you, Emmy. Good morning, sirs.

WATSON: Good morning.

HOLMES: Good morning. Please sit down, Mrs. Lakland. That's it. Now what's the trouble?

MRS. LAKLAND: It's Tom, sir. Me only son. He left me four months ago and I've not seen heir a night of him since.

HOLMES: You've had no message from him since he left?

MRS. LAKLAND: Not one word, I'm fair out of me mind, sir.

HOLMES: Have you any idea of his reason for leaving the village, Mrs. Lakland?

MRS. LAKLAND: None, sir. He was a good boy and he worked hard, and he didn't fool around with those flibbity gibbit girls in the village. I think he's met with foul play gentlemen, and I want you to find out about him for me, Mr. Holmes. I've heard say in the village that you're the greatest detective in England.

HOLMES: Mrs. Lakland, I'd be glad to help you, but you've given me no clues to work with. I'm afraid that I . . .

MRS. LAKLAND: If it's money you want I've got twenty pounds in me poster savings. It's all yours if you can bring my Tommy home to me. Or at least tell me he's safe.

HOLMES: Mrs. Lakland, I wouldn't dream of accepting a fee. However I shall give your problem some thought. If I arrive at any conclusions, I'll get in touch with you at once.

MRS. LAKLAND: God bless you, Mr. Holmes. Good morning to you, sirs.

HOLMES: Good day.

WATSON: Good morning, Mrs. Lakland. Poor old thing. I don't see how you can help her, Holmes.

HOLMES: Nor do I -- at the moment. But a young man who has grown up in a small village like this may have led a life that his mother is totally unaware of. You said that you have to work on one of your stories today, Watson.

WATSON: Yes I have a letter from the editor of the Strand magazine yesterday requesting a manuscript as soon as possible.

HOLMES: Splendid! Then you must stay at the Inn and work on your latest masterpiece, while I scour the village to see what may be found out about the missing young man.

WATSON: There you are, Holmes! I was beginning to think you got lost.

HOLMES: Hello, Watson. I trust you had a profitable session with pen and paper?

WATSON: I got about half a chapter. I would have done more if it hadn't been for those infernal bells.

HOLMES: The wedding ceremony that the worthy Gillian told us about this morning. Oh, I'm tired.

WATSON: What did you find out about Mrs. Lakland's son?

HOLMES: Among other things, that he had a secret love life unknown to his mother. And the object of his affections was none other than the maid who brought us our tea this morning.

WATSON: Mary! Did you talk to her?

HOLMES: No it's her half-day off and I was unable to find her. But I shall question her when she brings our tea tomorrow morning.

MICHOL: She didn't come to work. Must be ill again. Not a reliable girl, and no better than she ought to be if you ask me. It's no job for me to be carrying tea and hot water upstairs. 

HOLMES: I hear the village bell tolling for another funeral. Does Conforth have a burial every morning? I really don't see how the population can run to it.

MICHOL: It's another suicide, sir.

WATSON: Another suicide! Good Lord!

MICHOL: Old John Letterby, the baker. He was expecting some money from his son in Australia. It never came, and they foreclosed on his shop. And he hanged himself. Will you be wanting a couple of boiled eggs to your breakfast, gentlemen?

WATSON: No, no I haven't much of an appetite, thank you very much.

MICHOL: Yes, sir.

WATSON: That woman seems absolutely heartless. She almost smacks her lips when she tells us about these tragedies.

HOLMES: Yes, Watson, I noticed it. This peaceful village is beginning to seem strangely sinister to me. And since you have no appetite for breakfast, perhaps you'll join me in a little excursion as soon as you're dressed.

WATSON: Of course. Where're we going?

HOLMES: To see the maid, Mary. I'm anxious to talk to her before another funeral bell begins to toll.

WATSON: This must be the cottage home. They said it was the one with honeysuckle over the gate.

HOLMES: Yes, and there's Mary sitting on the porch.

WATSON: She's got up, she's coming up the path to meet us.

HOLMES: Good morning, Mary. I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

MARY: Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. Why've you come here? Not to ask about my health? Why should a servant girl matter to gentlemen like you?

WATSON: Oh, you misjudged us, my dear. I assure you that we . . .

HOLMES: No, Watson. Let's be honest and admit we didn't come here because of our concern for Mary's health. 

MARY: Then why did you come here, sir?

HOLMES: Mrs. Lakland asked me to try to find her son, Tom.

MARY: Tom?

HOLMES: Yes, Tom Lakland. I thought you might be able to help me, Marian.

MARY: If I could help you, Mr. Holmes, I'd be helping myself too. Here comes Gilly, the postman. 

F/X: FOOTSTEPS on DIRT 

MARY: Gilly, Gilly, is there a letter for me today?

GILLIAN: No, lass. There's nothing for you again.

MARY: There must, be Gilly, there must be there.

GILLIAN: No, lass. If the letter would come, I'd bring it to you as fast as me legs would carry me, you know that. Morning, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. Left some letters at the Inn for you, Doctor. You had a letter from a lady.

WATSON: How did you know it was from a lady?

GILLIAN: Reeked with the smell of violets, it did. And it was written in green ink on gray paper, sir.

WATSON: Amazing deduction.

HOLMES: That sounds like your young friend from Daylis, Watson.

WATSON: How did you know about??. I mean, I don't have a young friend from Daylis Watson.

HOLMES: Quite. Gilly, you tolled another funeral bell today, didn't you?

GILLIAN: Aye sir, and a tragic thing it was. Old Letterby hanged himself because he didn't get money from his son in Australia. I found him, I did. I was the one to cut him down. And right in me post bag was the letter he was waiting for. The letter that would have saved his life.

WATSON: Great Scott! What a ghastly piece of irony.

GILLIAN: That it was, sir. That it was. Well, gentlemen, I'll be on my way. Good day. Good day, Mary. Perhaps that letter will arrive tomorrow.

MARY: No. I'll never hear from Tom, now He's ashamed of me. That's why he deserted me.

HOLMES: Deserted you, Mary? You speak almost as if you were his wife.

MARY: I am his wife. 

WATSON: What?

MARY: We were married secretly in Rochdale five months ago come Tuesday.

HOLMES: And he never told his mother?

MARY: He was afraid to. She thought I was beneath him. Tom said he'd go away and get a good job and then return here and fetch me back with him. He went away all right. But he never came back or sent me a word.

HOLMES: When he left, did he give no clues to his destination? No hints of any kind, Mary?

MARY: Wait. He did once say "Mary, I'm gonna clear out to this puddle and make me fortune. Even if I have to bury it." And then he said, "Bury me fortune? Huh. That's a joke, isn't it?" I don't know what he meant by it.

HOLMES: I think I do, Mary. Watson, we're taking a short train journey as soon as possible.

WATSON: Oh? Where are we going? May I ask?

HOLMES: We're going to the town of Berry, in search of this young lady's husband.

MARY: What makes you think Tom might be in Berry, Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: Because the famous Fortune Cotton Mills are in Berry. It would seem possible that when your husband joked of burying his fortune, he was talking of going to the mills there.

MARY: Wherever he's gone, he won't be coming back for me. I know that.

WATSON: Now, now, now, now, don't talk like that, my dear. Remember you have friends, Mrs. Lakland.

WATSON: How much longer is Holmes going to be? He leaves me standing outside the factory gates as if I were a blasted coachman. Ah there he is, there he is! Holmes! Holmes!

HOLMES: Hello, Watson. Permit me to introduce you to Mr. Tom Lakland. Tom, this is Dr. Watson.

TOM: How do you do Dr. Watson.

WATSON: How do you do. Never mind how I do young fellow me lad. How do you do? Your behavior has been absolutely shocking. Shocking!

TOM: Now what are you talking about?

WATSON: Leaving your dear old mother and deserting your pretty little bride, because you're ashamed of her. You're a scoundrel sir. You deserve a good horsewhipping, and I have a good mind to give it to you.

TOM: I don't know what you're talking about Dr. Watson, but I don't like the words you use. And if it's violence you want, I don't mind telling you that I'm amateur heavyweight champion of the county.

WATSON: You are? Oh no need to become aggressive.

HOLMES: No let's waste time on being acrimonious Watson. Let's get back to the station as fast as we can. The return of the prodigal is long overdue. We must give them every opportunity to kill the fatted calf.

TOM: Ah, there's Mary's house, I'm dying to see her.

HOLMES: And after this reunion, Tom, I suggest that you both go over and see your mother. I'm sure she'll forgive you.

BELL: Now, Dr. Watson, that was a fine place to break off your story. You left me right on the edge of a cliff. Had the young girl shot herself?

WATSON: She'd shot at herself, Mr. Bell, but fortunately her last minute lack of courage had made her shot go wild. Homes and I and the young bridegroom burst into the house and rescued the smoking revolver from her hand. I must confess the reunion between the two young lovers was a touching sight. In fact, I felt considerably older than I was as Holmes and I stood there listening to Tom reassuring her.

TOM: Mary, darling, it's all right. I'm here.

MARY: Oh, Tom ,you are. You did come back for me. I thought you never would. I tried to kill myself but I hadn't the courage.

TOM: Oh there, there, Mary. Everything's going to be all right now.

MARY: It will be, Tom, won't it? Oh, I'm so tired.

HOLMES: And now, Tom, I think the time has come to reassure Mary that you did write to her.

TOM: Of course I did Mary, darling. I sent you money and told you that I'd be back here to take you to Berry as soon as I'd saved up enough.

MARY: You wrote to me, Tom?

TOM: Twice a week. And I wrote to mother, too. 

MARY: Then why didn't I get the letters?

HOLMES: The answer to that should be obvious my dear. Gilly the postman deliberately withheld them from you.

MARY: Gilly?

WATSON: Great heavens! Why?

HOLMES: I have my suspicions. Strong suspicions. But I have to get proof. Tell me Mary, the day before yesterday, Mr. Threadgold murdered his wife. Do you know how he learned of her infidelity?

MARY: Well, I'm not sure, but I did heard Mrs. Michol say it was through some letters that got mixed up. The letters addressed to her were delivered to his office instead of at the house.

WATSON: Gilly again.

HOLMES: Precisely! Surely the whole terrible pattern begins to take shape. Tom?

TOM: Yes, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: I'm going to lay a trap. To spring it I shall need your assistance.

TOM: Of course, Mr. Holmes, I'll do anything. 

HOLMES: Wait here with Mary until darkness falls. Then muffle yourselves up and go to your mother's house. Wait there in hiding and let no outsiders see you until you hear from me.

WATSON: Since you two love birds have been separated for four months I don't imagine that will be too unpleasant.

HOLMES: Quiet, Watson. You understand, Tom?

TOM: Yes, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: Good. Come on, Watson.

WATSON: What's your plan, Holmes?

HOLMES: I'll tell you as we go. One thing I can promise you. Before the sun is very high tomorrow I shall free this village from one of the most subtly evil powers I've ever come in contact with.

WATSON: That's very chaitable, Mrs. Michol, I must say, in any case the vicar says that the poor girl was of unsound mind.

HOLMES: Yes, madam, you can't blame her.

MICHOL: Well, I'll be getting into the church.

WATSON: Holmes this farce is beginning to get on my nerves. What are we accomplishing by burying an empty coffin?

HOLMES: Then we must handle him to the best of our ability, Watson.

WATSON: Well I must say I do not relish the thought of a tussle high in the belfry of a church. The man must be insane.

HOLMES: Obviously. That's why his power must be destroyed. This door apparently leads to the belfry. Keep your wits about you Watson.

[they all shout over the bells]

HOLMES: Good morning, Gilly.

GILLIAN: Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. You've come to see me at work. That's nice of ya. Not often I get company up here. 

HOLMES: We haven't come up here to see you at work, Gilly. We know your diabolical work only too well.

WATSON: Yes, Gilly, we know your secret.

GILLIAN: What secret's that?

HOLMES: You're mad with power, Gilly. You've tried to control the destiny of this village. In your position as postman you thought you have the power to give life and death.

GILLIAN: That I am sir, and it's a great power. It makes a man feel good. Almost like a god you might say.

WATSON: That's sacrilege you scoundrel. You were responsible for the murder of Mrs. Threadgold.

GILLIAN: Aye sir. That I was, and for the old man hanging himself.

HOLMES: You were responsible for John Letterby's suicide weren't you?

GILLIAN: That I was. Letterby tried to vote me off the village council. I swore I'd make him pay for it. And I did.

HOLMES: Your reign is over Gillian. You'll never toll a bell again. The only one you'll hear will be a prison bell.

GILLIAN: You can't touch me, Mr. Holmes. You've got no proof. There's nothing you can do.

HOLMES: Don't be too sure. I have enough influence to take your job away.

GILLIAN: You, you, You'd take me away from me bells? I live for these bells. You wouldn't take me away from them?

HOLMES: You couldn't live without the power they give you. Could you, Gilly?

GILLIAN: You're trying to destroy me. 

HOLMES: You are already destroyed, Gilly.

WATSON: Yes, you've already failed. Mary's alive.

GILLIAN: A-Alive? But the coffin they're burying down there?

HOLMES: Is full of stone. You'll be the laughing stock of the village, Gilly.

GILLIAN: They'll never laugh at Gilly. (fade off mic) You can't catch me, Mr. Holmes. I'm beyond you still!

F/X: Gilly running up a SQUEAKY LADDER

WATSON: He's running up the ladder leading to the bell tower.

HOLMES: Come back, Gilly, come back!

WATSON: He's mad as a hatter.

HOLMES: Quite.

WATSON: What's he going to do up there? He might set fire to the steeple. Could make any madness. I'm going to fetch him, Holmes.

HOLMES: No, Watson. He drew a knife as he fled. And with that rickety staircase and the narrow opening leading into the bell chamber you'd never stand a chance. He'd get you on the first ledge.

WATSON: How're we going to get him down?

HOLMES: There's only one way. He's in a tiny loft containing his beloved bells. We'll see how much he loves them at close quarters. I doubt if even he can stand the noise in that confined space. Where's that bell rope?

F/X: BELLS begin to TOLL LOUDLY

WATSON: Come down, Gilly. Come down from there.

GILLIAN: Stop! Stop ringing me bell!

HOLMES: Not until you come down, Gilly.

GILLIAN: Stop ringing them! I can't stand it. You'll make me mad.

HOLMES: You are mad, Gilly. Mad with power. Come down here I say.

GILLIAN: I'm coming! [Gilly screams as he jumps from the tower]

F/X: BODY THUD TO GROUND

WATSON: Great Heavens, he hurled himself out of the belfry. Holmes, he hasn't the chance of surviving that fall.

HOLMES: I had no intention of causing that unhappy man to jump to his death, Watson. Though I can't help but feel that his poor, demented mind may find a happier oblivion this way rather than in the confines of an asylum.

WATSON: Yes, you're probably right, Holmes.

HOLMES: It's been a shocking case, Watson. Shocking. And once again it proves the old saying that "violence does intrude recoil upon the violent." And, "the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another."

BELL: Now, Dr. Watson, what about next week?

Christmas. And in the glow and glory of it, I called at Baker Street to see my old friend Sherlock Holmes. (APPROACHES, FROM OFF) Compliments of the season, Holmes!

HOLMES: (PREOCCUPIED) Eh? Who? What? Who's that?

WATSON: (ON) Compliments of the season, Holmes.

HOLMES: (ABSENTLY CURT) Oh, Watson, it's you. Good evening, how do you do?

WATSON: Ah, I say that's a deuced cold greeting for the time of year. Or don't you believe in the Christmas spirit?

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Yes, yes, of course I do, my dear fellow. It's only that I'm profoundly engaged. My mind was elsewhere. Er, close the door, Watson. Come in. There's a confounded din from the street.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES, CUTTING OFF CITY BACKGROUND AND CAROLING CHILDREN

HOLMES: Yes, that's much better. Sit down, won't you?

WATSON: Of course, if you're engaged, Holmes, I'd better not stay. I've still some visits to make to my patients.

HOLMES: No, no, no, no. Of course! You know how glad I always am to have you, old friend, to discuss my problems with. Now, help yourself to a whiskey and soda, Watson.

WATSON: Oh, thank you.

HOLMES: (SLOWLY) And just tell me what you think of that.

WATSON: Think of what?

HOLMES: That. Hanging on the back of the chair there. I've been contemplating it for the last half hour.

WATSON: (PUZZLED) It's, er-- It's only a hat. Er, a simple hard black hat.

HOLMES: Just so.

WATSON: You'd best sit down with me by the fire and tell me all about it, and I'll brew some punch.

SOUND: WATSON PUTTERS WITH GLASSES AND UTENSILS, IN BG, IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

HOLMES: Excellent. Excellent, Watson. You know where everything is, of course. And meanwhile I'll tell you the tale of this hat -- and I ask you to consider it, Watson, not as a battered old billycock, but as an intellectual problem.

WATSON: Well, let me find the nutmeg grater first and I'm ready. Where--? Er, yes. Ah, here it is.

HOLMES: Well, then. You know Peterson, the commissionaire at the hotel on the corner?

WATSON: But of course. Why? Is it his hat?

HOLMES: No, his trophy.

WATSON: Huh? Trophy?

HOLMES: Well, he found it. The owner is unknown. It arrived here, Watson, in company with a fine fat goose, which I have no doubt at this moment is roasting merrily in front of the Petersons' fire.

WATSON: (AMUSED) Oh ho. Well! A goose and a hat. No doubt the connection's obvious, but, er-- But, er-- (PUZZLED) Where - where - where do you put the lemons, my dear fella?

HOLMES: Lemons? Oh, try the gasogene stand.

SOUND: WATSON TRIES THE GASOGENE STAND

WATSON: No.

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) Oh, well, then that hideous bamboo smoking companion that Mrs. Hudson will insist on setting down beside the sofa every afternoon.

WATSON: Ah, yes! Here we are.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Well now, the facts are these, Watson: Peterson -- who is a very honest fellow, as you know -- was returning about four o'clock this morning from some small seasonal jollification and walking homewards down the Tottenham Court Road.

WATSON: Oh, ah, stir the fire a bit, will you? My hands are full.

HOLMES: Certainly, Watson. Heh! Of course.

SOUND: HOLMES STIRS THE FIRE

HOLMES: In front of him, there in the gaslight, Peterson suddenly saw a tallish man with a stick, walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose over his shoulder.

WATSON: Uh-huh.

HOLMES: As he reached the corner of Warren Street, this man was suddenly set upon by a crowd of roughs. One of them knocked his hat off and as he raised his stick to defend himself, he accidentally swung it against a shop window and smashed the glass.

WATSON: (AMUSED) Oh ho! Well, what happened next, Holmes?

HOLMES: Well, Peterson, who was still wearing his commissionaire's uniform, rushed to the man's assistance. But the fellow, shocked at breaking a window and seeing a man in uniform running up to him, dropped his goose and took to his heels.

WATSON: Huh.

HOLMES: The roughs did the same, leaving Peterson master of the field of battle. He brought both bird and hat to me. There was a card on the bird's leg with "For Mrs. Henry Baker" written on it and the initials "H. B." are written on the label inside the hat.

WATSON: Ah ha.

HOLMES: But of course there are some thousands of people named Baker in this great city of ours, so it has been my little occupation for this last hour or so to try and deduce the exact identity of this one.

WATSON: From his hat?

HOLMES: Yes, Watson. (THOUGHTFUL) The owner of this hat, Watson-- (SOUND: DRINK POURED) --highly intellectual, fairly well-to-do, but in the space of the last three years seems to have fallen on evil days. He used to have foresight, but he has less now than formerly. I suspect he's taken to drink, which would also perhaps account for the fact that his wife no longer loves him.

WATSON: (LAUGHS HEARTILY) Oh, my dear Holmes.

HOLMES: (CONTINUES) Middle-aged, goes out little, has grizzled hair -- which he anoints with lime-cream -- and has been to the barber's lately. It is also extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.

WATSON: (CHUCKLES, SKEPTICAL) Ah, come, Holmes. Now you're surely joking.

HOLMES: Not at all.

WATSON: Now, I've seen you at this kind of thing before, of course, but this is going too far. His wife, Holmes--

HOLMES: Ah?

WATSON: You said she'd stopped loving him.

HOLMES: (SIMPLY) The hat hasn't been brushed for weeks, my dear fellow.

WATSON: (CONFUSED) What?

HOLMES: Well, when I see you, Watson, with such an accumulation of dust on your respectable headgear, I shall expect you to be returning to your old quarters here within the next day or two.

WATSON: (LAUGHS) Oh, Holmes, Holmes -- you have an answer for everything. Wonderful, wonderful. (MORE SERIOUS) Except the gas. The fact that there's no gas laid on in his house, now that really is impossible.

HOLMES: Not at all. One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance, but when I see no less than five, I think there can be little doubt that the owner must be brought in frequent contact with burning tallow. Yes, he probably walks upstairs at night with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow stains from a gasjet. Satisfied?

WATSON: Ha! 'Pon my soul, 'pon my soul, it's really, really most - most ingenious.

HOLMES: Elementary, my dear Watson.

WATSON: (LAUGHS) Well, actually, it seems rather a waste of your talents, for there's been no crime committed. Nothing but the loss of a Christmas goose.

HOLMES: That goose, my dear fellow--

SOUND: SHARP KNOCKING AT DOOR

PETERSON: (BEHIND DOOR, URGENT) Mr. Holmes?

SOUND: MORE KNOCKING

PETERSON: (BEHIND DOOR) Mr. Holmes, sir, are you in?

HOLMES: Hello, hello, what's this? Who is it? (CALLS) Yes? Come in!

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

PETERSON: (AGITATED) Mr. Holmes?

HOLMES: My dear Peterson!

PETERSON: (BREATHLESS) Oh-- It's - it's the goose, sir.

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) Well, has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window? You're as white as a sheet.

PETERSON: Oh, well-- See here, sir. Here. Look what my wife found inside its crop.

HOLMES: (BEAT, ASTONISHED) Watson! Look.

WATSON: (AMAZED) This - this is a treasure trove indeed, Peterson. Yes, a precious stone. One of the biggest I've ever seen.

HOLMES: It's more than a precious stone, Watson. It's the precious stone. The blue carbuncle.

WATSON: Great heavens! The - the Countess of Morcar's?

HOLMES: Precisely. Missing for five days and with a descriptive advertisement every morning in The Times about it. And a reward of a thousand pounds for its recovery.

PETERSON: (STUNNED) Thousand pounds? Cor, love a duck.

WATSON: A goose, Peterson.

PETERSON: A blue carbuncle?

WATSON: Yes, yes, I remember now. Lost at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.

HOLMES: That's it, and they've arrested some plumber fellow who's supposed to have taken it from the countess's jewel case.

PETERSON: (DISBELIEF) A thousand pounds reward. Oh, cor.

WATSON: I was reading about it only just now. (SOUND: RUSTLE OF NEWSPAPER) Yes. Here we are, here we are. (READS) "The Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, plumber, twenty-six, was brought up on the charge of having abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle."

HOLMES: What else, Watson?

WATSON: Well, it seems that this fellow Horner was taken up to the countess's room by her maid -- a girl called Catherine Cusack -- to do some kind of repair.

HOLMES: Hmm.

WATSON: When the head attendant of the hotel went in -- a fellow called James Ryder -- to see if the work was finished, he found the jewel case was lying empty and that Horner had gone. Then he gave the alarm and Horner was found by the police and they arrested him. The case has been referred to the Assizes.

HOLMES: Hmm. Well, then the only problem remaining to be solved is the sequence of events leading from an empty jewel-case in a hotel room at one end, to the crop of a goose in the Tottenham Court Road at the other. Er, just give me a pencil and that slip of paper, will you, Peterson?

PETERSON: Huh? Oh-- Oh, yes, sir. (TO HIMSELF) Thousand pounds. Oh, blow me down. (TO HOLMES) Here, sir.

WATSON: What are you going to do, Holmes?

HOLMES: Find the owner of this hat. (AS HE WRITES) "H. B., Henry Baker." (TO WATSON) Yes, he began as a joke and now he's become a mystery. We'll try the simplest method first -- an advertisement. How's this, Watson? Read it.

WATSON: (READS) "Found at the corner of [Tottenham Court Road and] Warren Street: a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at six-thirty this evening at Two-Two-One Baker Street."

HOLMES: Clear and concise, I think. Yes, if you've quite recovered from your astonishment, Peterson--

PETERSON: (HE HASN'T) Sir?

HOLMES: (AMUSED) Just run down to the advertisement office and have this put in all the evening papers, will you?

PETERSON: All of them, sir?

HOLMES: All of them. Oh, and by the way, Peterson--?

PETERSON: Sir?

HOLMES: On your way back, just see if you can buy another goose.

PETERSON: Another goose, sir?

HOLMES: Yes, as near as possible the same size as that one that your family is about to devour.

PETERSON: Oh. Oh! Oh, yes, sir. (CONCERNED) Um, you're going to keep the stone, sir?

HOLMES: Yes, here in my strong-box. And I'll just drop a note to the Countess to say we found it. Hurry up, Peterson.

PETERSON: Oh, yes, sir! (MOVING OFF, TO HIMSELF) Thousand pounds. Cor! Cor, stone the crows.

WATSON: No, no -- the geese, Peterson.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES)

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

MUSIC: BRIDGE

HOLMES: Ah, Mr. Henry Baker, if I am not mistaken. Do come in, Mr. Baker.

BAKER: Oh, thank you, sir.

HOLMES: Sit down, won't you? Pray, sit down.

BAKER: (SITS) Thank you.

HOLMES: This is my good friend, Dr. Watson.

BAKER: How do you do, sir?

WATSON: How do you do?

HOLMES: Mayn't I help you to a whiskey and soda, Mr. Baker?

BAKER: (VERY PLEASED) Oh - oh - oh, thank you. I'll, er-- I'll leave out the soda if I may, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: (WITH A CHUCKLE) Oh, of course.

SOUND: DRINK POURED

HOLMES: (PLEASED) You see, Watson?

WATSON: Congratulations, Holmes. The very man as you described him.

BAKER: I beg your pardon?

WATSON: Oh, nothing, sir. Forgive us; a private matter.

HOLMES: Now, Mr. Baker, you've come, haven't you, in answer to my advertisement? Er, is this your hat?

BAKER: This? Oh, yes, sir, undoubtedly.

HOLMES: Then pray allow me to return it to you with my compliments. The bird, I am afraid, we've been compelled to eat.

BAKER: (SHAKEN) What? Oh, dear.

WATSON: Careful - careful, Mr. Baker. You'll - you'll spill your drink.

HOLMES: It was quite a necessity, I'm afraid, since in these modern days we seem to have lost the art of refrigeration in which our Elizabethan ancestors were so adept. However, there's this other bird here on the sideboard to which you're extremely welcome as a replacement.

BAKER: (RELIEVED) That's uncommonly kind of you, sir.

HOLMES: Not at all. (CAREFULLY) Of course, er, we still have the feathers and the crop of your own bird, if you'd like to take them, too.

BAKER: (LAUGHS) Oh, you're an honest man, sir, but the Disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are hardly likely to be of much use to me. (CHUCKLES)

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES)

BAKER: But - but I will have one more drink, if I may. Very small.

SOUND: DRINK POURED BEHIND--

HOLMES: Most certainly. Would it trouble you, Mr. Baker, to tell me where you got that uncommonly fine bird of yours?

BAKER: Not at all, sir. I'm a member of a Christmas goose club run by the landlord at the Alpha Inn near the Museum.

HOLMES: The Alpha Inn, Watson.

WATSON: (POLITELY INTERESTED) Ah ha.

BAKER: I got it there in exchange for my weekly four pences, which I've been paying since last April.

WATSON: Well, that's good value for twelve shillings, Mr. Baker, eh? (CHUCKLES)

BAKER: Yes, yes. I really am most grateful to you for your kindness, sir. I was set on by some roughs in the street and I - I lost it.

HOLMES: All's well that ends well, Mr. Baker. We were fortunate enough to find it, so-- Here's your hat.

BAKER: Thank you.

HOLMES: And here is your new bird. Oh, I've put the old ticket onto it -- the one that was tied to the other goose's leg -- marked "To Mrs. Henry Baker."

BAKER: (VERY PLEASED) Oh, how nice of you. I - I'm much obliged, sir.

HOLMES: Well, not at all. A peace offering, Mr. Baker?

BAKER: (YES) A peace offering, sir, in point of fact -- to my better half.

HOLMES: Ah, quite.

BAKER: Good night, sir, and thank you again.

WATSON: Good night.

HOLMES: Good night, Mr. Baker.

BAKER: Good night, sir.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS BAKER EXITS

MUSIC: CHILDREN SING "O COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL" ... FADES IN DURING FOLLOWING ... THEN IN BG--

HOLMES: Well, well, well. So much for Mr. Henry Baker, Watson.

WATSON: It's quite evident that he was innocent, of course, from the trap you laid -- I mean, about the feathers and the crop.

HOLMES: Yes, evident. I suggest, Watson, that we turn that proposed dinner of ours into a late supper. I'll tell Mrs. Hudson -- she'll forgive us -- and in the meanwhile let's follow up the clew of the Alpha Inn.

WATSON: By all means, Holmes. I confess I'm most intrigued.

HOLMES: Yes, I'm afraid we shall have to battle our way out through those infernal waifs who are making night so hideous on our humble doorstep. Come, Watson -- we've work to do this Christmas Eve.

MUSIC: CHILDREN SING "O COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL" ... UP TO FILL A PAUSE ... THEN FADE OUT ... THEN SOLO VIOLIN FOR TRANSITION

SOUND: NOCTURNAL CITY BACKGROUND

WATSON: (NARRATES) It was a bitter night and so we drew on our Ulsters and wrapped our mufflers about our throats. We swung through the doctors' quarter of Wimpole Street and Harley Street, and so along the great thoroughfare of Oxford Street, where the crowds were thinning now, to Bloomsbury. And there, in a forgotten corner, we found the Alpha Inn -- and from the rosy landlord learnt that the geese for his Christmas club had come from a dealer named Breckinridge in Covent Garden.

SOUND: MARKET BACKGROUND (HORSES, CABS, PEOPLE, ET CETERA) ... HOLMES AND WATSON'S STEPS APPROACH AND STOP

WATSON: Yes! Here's the market, Holmes. What was the name of the goose dealer?

HOLMES: Breckinridge, Watson. Here, there it is -- you see? The largest stall of the lot. There's the name written up over it.

WATSON: Yes! Just in time: they're closing up. Hmmm! Horsy-looking fella, isn't he?

HOLMES: What's that you say? Horsy? (PLEASED) Good for you, Watson. That fact might come in useful. (BEAT, WINNINGLY) Ah, good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. Mm, it's a cold night.

BRECKINRIDGE: (CURT) Yeah, cold enough, I reckon. Glad to get finished.

HOLMES: Sold out of geese, I see.

BRECKINRIDGE: Let you have five hundred tomorrow morning.

HOLMES: Ah, that's no good, I'm afraid. We want one tonight.

BRECKINRIDGE: Here, there's some on that stall over there with the gas-flare. Now, excuse me, sir.

WATSON: Well, we were recommended to you particularly, Mr. Breckinridge.

BRECKINRIDGE: Oh? Who by?

WATSON: By the landlord of the Alpha Inn in Bloomsbury.

HOLMES: Yes, you supplied him with some incomparable birds, he told us. Where did you get them from, by the way?

BRECKINRIDGE: (ANNOYED) Now look here! What exactly are you drivin' at, mister?

HOLMES: Why, nothing, only that I wanted to know who sold you those geese.

BRECKINRIDGE: (DEFIANT) I'm dashed if I'll tell you, then! You're another one to pester me, are ya?

HOLMES: Another one? What do you mean?

BRECKINRIDGE: (EXPLODES) When I pay good money for a thing, that should be the end of it I say. But it's "where are those geese?" and "who did you sell those geese to?" till I'm sick of it! You'd think that lot were the only geese in the world the way some folk keep on at me about 'em!

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) Well, I can assure you that we've nothing to do with any other people who've been making inquiries, Mr. Breckinridge. In fact, all I'm concerned with-- (CHUCKLE) --is a little bet I've made.

BRECKINRIDGE: (INTERESTED) A bet?

HOLMES: Just so. I'm always ready to back my opinion and I bet a fiver with my friend the doctor here that the bird we et from the Alpha Inn was country bred.

BRECKINRIDGE: You've lost your fiver then, 'cause it was town bred.

HOLMES: No-no-no, it was nothing of the kind.

BRECKINRIDGE: (EXPLODES) It was, I tell you! Cor, do you think you know more about fowls than I do when I've been in the trade, man and boy, for--?

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTS) I tell you, it's country bred.

BRECKINRIDGE: It's town! Here, will you take a bet with me, too?

HOLMES: With pleasure. A sovereign. Every penny of it.

BRECKINRIDGE: Right! It's on now! Where's that ruddy book of mine? Haha! Here it is. Here. Just look in here, Mr. Cocksure!

SOUND: BOOK OPENED, PAGES FLIPPED

HOLMES: Well, what's this?

BRECKINRIDGE: That's the list of the folk I buy from, see? And what I do with the stuff when I've bought it. Now then, look at that line there. Do you see?

HOLMES: Can you see it, Watson, in this light?

WATSON: Yes, yes. "Mrs. Oakshott," isn't it?

BRECKINRIDGE: That's right, Mrs. Oakshott. And what's the address, eh?

WATSON: (READS) "A Hundred-and-Seventeen Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier."

BRECKINRIDGE: (TRIUMPHANT, TO HOLMES) Brixton Road, Mr. High and Mighty! (TO WATSON) And what's the last entry under it, eh?

WATSON: (READS) "December the twenty-second. Twenty-four geese at seven and six."

BRECKINRIDGE: And who were they sold to, eh?

WATSON: (READS) "Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha at twelve shillings."

BRECKINRIDGE: Right! (TO HOLMES) And so what do you say now, Mr. Bloomin' Poultry Fancier?!

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES RUEFULLY) Well, I must say, I could have sworn it was country bred. All right, you win, Mr. Breckinridge.

BRECKINRIDGE: (CACKLES HAPPILY)

HOLMES: There's your sovereign.

BRECKINRIDGE: Thank you.

HOLMES: Come along, doctor. I owe you five, I think.

WATSON: (PLEASED) Yes, you do!

BRECKINRIDGE: Easy money, that's what I say! Haha! Well, good evening, gents! A merry Christmas to ye!

HOLMES: (MOVING OFF, CHEERFUL) Good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. (BEAT, ON MIKE, THOUGHTFUL) Well, Watson, let's stand here by the gas lamp for a moment. I want to think.

SOUND: VOICES OF BRECKINRIDGE AND RYDER ARGUE VIOLENTLY, SLIGHTLY OFF

BRECKINRIDGE: I tell you, I don't know nothin' about it!

RYDER: Well, you ruddy well ought to, then!

BRECKINRIDGE: You get of out of here, I say!

RYDER: I'll stay where I want to!

BRECKINRIDGE: You'll what?

SOUND: ARGUMENT CONTINUES, INDECIPHERABLY, IN BG

HOLMES: Hello, what's going on?

WATSON: There's some kind of a quarrel, Holmes, back there at Breckinridge's stall.

HOLMES: (PLEASED) Oh, yes. So there is. Let's see what's the matter.

WATSON: Look. Look, that little rat-faced fellow -- do you see? Breckinridge is threatening him.

SOUND: ARGUING VOICES OF BRECKINRIDGE AND RYDER GROW LOUDER ... MURMUR OF ONLOOKERS HOPING FOR A FIGHT, IN BG

BRECKINRIDGE: Now, I tell you, I've had enough of you -- and your bloomin' geese!

RYDER: I was only asking ye.

BRECKINRIDGE: Yeah, well, you've asked the same before and you got the same ruddy answer! You and anybody else!

RYDER: One of them geese was mine, I say.

BRECKINRIDGE: Well, you can ask Mrs. Bloomin' Oakshott for it.

RYDER: She told me to ask you!

BRECKINRIDGE: Yeah? Then you can ask the King of Prussia for all I care! You get off now. Go on, or I'll knock your teeth out, mind ye.

ONLOOKERS: "Here, here!" "He's goin'!" "Give it to them teeth, honey boy!

BRECKINRIDGE: Go on, ya bloomin' nosy parker, ye!

SOUND: ONLOOKERS LAUGH AND FADE OUT DURING FOLLOWING, REPLACED BY CITY TRAFFIC BACKGROUND--

HOLMES: (QUIETLY DELIGHTED) The little fellow's coming this way, Watson. It looks as if we've saved our trip to Brixton.

WATSON: You want me to collar him?

HOLMES: Stand by if he gets nasty. He looks a bit of a shrimp, though; not much trouble. (CALLS, TO RYDER) Here, my man! Not so fast. I'd just like a word with you.

RYDER: (STARTLED) What? Here, who are you? What do you want?

HOLMES: I couldn't help overhearing your little disagreement with the good salesman over there, and I think I might be able to assist you.

RYDER: How do you mean? How could you know anything? Who are you, eh?

HOLMES: My name is Sherlock Holmes, and it's my business to know what other people don't know.

RYDER: (DISMISSIVE) Well, you can't know anything about this.

HOLMES: On the contrary. You're trying to trace some geese, which were sold by a Mrs. Oakshott, to that man there, who sold them to the landlord of the Alpha Inn, who got rid of them through his goose club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.

RYDER: (ASTONISHED) What?! Why, you're the very man I've been looking for, Mr. Holmes. Oh, I can hardly tell you how much it means to me.

HOLMES: Watson, be good enough to signal for a four-wheeler, will you?

WATSON: Yes, certainly. (CALLS) Cabbie!

HOLMES: I think, my friend, we'd better discuss this whole matter in some cozy place rather than in the crowded street. We'll go to my room, shall we? Oh, what's your name, may I ask?

RYDER: (UNCONVINCING) My name's, er, Robinson. John Robinson.

HOLMES: No-no-no, the real name. It's always so awkward doing business with an alias.

RYDER: All right then. James Ryder.

HOLMES: Ah! Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, I believe.

RYDER: Yeh.

HOLMES: Quite so. You have the cab, Watson?

WATSON: Just coming over, Holmes.

HOLMES: Splendid, splendid. Now, would you mind just standing on Mr. Ryder's other side and, er-- (LOWERS HIS VOICE) --just take him by the arm, will you? He might have a fancy to go for a little walk.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE ... SCENE FADES IN

HOLMES: Well now, here we are. The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. Do put some more coal on, would you, Watson?

SOUND: COAL ON FIRE

HOLMES: Now then, pray take the basket-chair, Mr. Ryder. You look chilly.

WATSON: I'll make some more punch I think, Holmes. We could all do with a warming.

HOLMES: Thank you, Watson, if you will! You'll find the lemons behind you on the gasogene stand.

WATSON: And the nutmeg scraper?

HOLMES: There, behind the Persian slipper. Oh, you might hand it to me, will you, dear fellow? I'd like some tobacco.

WATSON: Certainly.

HOLMES: Thank you so much. Well now, Mr. Ryder--

RYDER: Yes, sir?

HOLMES: You, er-- You want to know what became of those geese, Mr. Ryder -- or rather of that goose, for I fancy it was only one that you were interested in: a white one with a black bar across its tail.

RYDER: (ANXIOUS) Oh, if you could only tell me, sir, I'd be that grateful. It's really mine, you see, sir. It was sold by mistake.

HOLMES: (LAUGHS BRIEFLY) And a most remarkable bird, if I may say so, Mr. Ryder. Watson, hand me over my strong-box, if you please.

SOUND: STRONG-BOX HANDED OVER

HOLMES: Ah, that bird laid an egg after it was dead, Mr. Ryder.

RYDER: What?

HOLMES: The bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here.

SOUND: STRONG-BOX UNLOCKS AND OPENS

RYDER: (STAGGERED) Cor, merciful heaven!

HOLMES: The game's up, Ryder.

RYDER: (COUGHS, BREATHES HEAVILY, IN BG)

WATSON: Steady, man, steady -- or you'll be in the fire.

HOLMES: Hang on to him, Watson!

WATSON: It's all right, Holmes, I've got him. Almost fainting, poor devil. I'll get him a brandy.

HOLMES: Poor devil, hey? Heavens, what a worm the fellow is. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony.

SOUND: DRINK HANDED OVER

WATSON: Well, there you are, my man. Drink it up.

RYDER: (DRINKS, EXHALES) Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. (IN DESPAIR) Ohhhh, what have I done? What have I done?

HOLMES: You know perfectly well what you've done, Ryder. It only needs one or two more links, Watson, to make the case complete. Now then, Ryder, who told you of the Countess of Morcar's jewel, the blue carbuncle?

RYDER: It was Catherine Cusack, sir. I swear it was her idea.

WATSON: The countess's waiting-maid, Holmes!

HOLMES: Exactly. And so you invented some excuse to send that unfortunate young Horner into the countess's hotel room -- and after he was gone, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and put the blame onto him.

RYDER: Yes, sir, I did, sir.

HOLMES: (JUST AS HE THOUGHT) Ah.

RYDER: (WILDLY) Oh, for heaven's sake, have mercy, Mr. Holmes. I - I never went wrong before. It was Cathy was to blame! Please, sir--

HOLMES: Get up off the floor, man! It's no good kneeling to me. You didn't show much mercy to Horner, did you?

RYDER: I - I'll leave the country, sir. The charge will break down against him.

HOLMES: Get up. Get up! Watson, help him onto his feet, for heaven's sake.

WATSON: What I want to know is how the stone got into the goose, Ryder. There, man -- take another drink.

RYDER: (DRINKS, EXHALES, CALMER) Well, it - it was all a mistake, you see, sir. Once I had it, I wanted to hide it somewhere. It seemed to burn a hole in me pocket. So I went to my sister's, you see, to think things out--

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTS) Your sister?

RYDER: Maggie. She married a man called Oakshott.

HOLMES: Aha.

RYDER: She fattens fowls for the market at Brixton.

WATSON: Ah, Oakshott, eh?

RYDER: Well, I was thinking it out in our yard, see -- smokin' a pipe like -- and I remembered that Maggie had promised me a bird for Christmas, so-- Well, I had an idea.

HOLMES: Ah, you forced the stone down the bird's throat.

RYDER: (EXHALES) Yes, sir. Well, just then, Maggie come out to see what I was up to and the bird got free for a minute, but I went and caught it again, and Maggie and I killed it. I had a notion to take the stone to a chap I know up in Kilburn that told me once he knew how to get rid of stolen property. And I thought it would be safe from any search in the bird's crop, you see, sir, even if the police did take it into their hands to stop me. They weren't all that certain about Horner, you see.

WATSON: Aha -- and when you got to Kilburn, it wasn't there.

RYDER: No, sir. So I rushed back to Maggie. By that time all the other birds had gone to market, see? There was two of 'em with barred tails, you see, sir. I'd caught the wrong one after it'd got away. I've been at that stall at the Garden ever since, trying to find out where it had gone. (IN DESPAIR AGAIN) Oh, Mr. Holmes--!

WATSON: Ah! Well, what are you going to do, Holmes?

HOLMES: (MOVING TO THE DOOR, SLOW AND THOUGHTFUL) I'm not quite sure, but I think, all things considered, it might be best to--

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

HOLMES: (SHARPLY) --get out, Ryder!

RYDER: (CONFUSED) What? You mean--?

HOLMES: I mean get out, man!

RYDER: (RELIEVED) Oh, heaven bless you, Mr. Holmes!

HOLMES: I don't want to hear any more from you; get out.

RYDER: Oh, thank you, Mr. Holmes--

HOLMES: Get out!

RYDER: -- and heaven bless you, sir.

SOUND: DOOR SHUTS AS RYDER EXITS ... HOLMES STEPS TO WATSON

HOLMES: (QUIETLY CONTEMPLATIVE) Well, well! A most singular and whimsical business, my dear Watson.

WATSON: Ah, my dear Holmes, shouldn't you have turned him in?

HOLMES: Well, when all is said and done, Watson, I'm really not retained by the police to supplement their deficiencies. As soon as I send the stone back, the case against Horner will collapse at once. There'll be no witness.

WATSON: But you're committing a felony, you know.

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) Well, it's just possible that I'm also saving a soul. I don't believe he'll go wrong again. (WITH A CHUCKLE) He's too scared. Besides, Watson--

SOUND: DISTANT CLOCK STARTS TO CHIME MIDNIGHT, IN BG

WATSON: What?

HOLMES: Well, this is the season of forgiveness, man. (BEAT) Listen. Twelve o'clock! It's Christmas Day. (BEAT) Oh, pass me some of that delicious punch of yours, won't you? And tell me you forgive me, too.

WATSON: (AMUSED) Forgive you? In heaven's name, for what?

MUSIC: MANY JOYOUS RINGING CHURCH BELLS JOIN THE CHIMING ... THEN CONTINUE IN BG

HOLMES: For being so surly yesterday morning when you offered me the compliments of the season. I return them now with all my heart. And here's your health, old friend, with my glass upraised. A merry Christmas, my dear Watson.

WATSON: A merry Christmas, Holmes!

HOLMES: God save her gracious Majesty.

WATSON: Amen!

MUSIC: GLASSES CLINK ... THEN BELLS, UP BIG FOR A CURTAIN ... THEN SLOWLY FADE OUT

ANNOUNCER: "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," the original and immortal stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle dramatized anew, with Sir Ralph Richardson as Dr. Watson and Sir John Gielgud in the role of Sherlock Holmes. 

MUSIC: SOLO VIOLIN ... UP TO FILL A PAUSE ... THEN BEHIND WATSON--

WATSON: (NARRATES) Many of the cases of Sherlock Holmes were private affairs that made no stir outside the family circles involved, but the disappearance of Silver Blaze was a matter which set the whole country by the ears -- for not merely had this horse, the favorite for the Wessex Cup, vanished for a week before the great race, but his trainer had also been tragically murdered.

SOUND: MOVING TRAIN INTERIOR BACKGROUND

WATSON: (FADES IN, READING ALOUD) "--John Straker, the trainer, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables." 

HOLMES: I see you have some newspapers there, Watson. Let's see what they have to say about the matter.

SOUND: RUSTLE OF NEWSPAPERS IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

WATSON: Oh. Well, er-- Here's the-- Here's the Morning Post. It says, uh-- (READS) "The horses had been exercised and watered as usual and the stables locked up at nine o'clock. Two of the lads walked up to the trainer's house where they had supper in the kitchen whilst the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. A few minutes after nine, the maid, Edith Baxter, carried his supper, a dish of curried mutton, down to the stables. As the path ran over the open moor, she carried a lantern with her. About thirty yards away from the stables a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop." 

SOUND: SCENE ABRUPTLY FADES OUT ... THEN FADE IN SCENE WITH SHARP WIND BLOWING IN BG

STRANGER: (AFFABLY SINISTER) Excuse me, miss?

MAID: (STARTLED GASP) 

STRANGER: Can you tell me where I am? I'd almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor when I saw your lantern. 

MAID: (NERVOUS) You're close to King's Pyland training stable, sir. 

STRANGER: I am? What a stroke of luck. I understand that the stable boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that's his supper you're carrying. 

MAID: Yes, sir, but it'll be gettin' cold. 

STRANGER: Yes, but, um-- You wouldn't be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, now would you? See the boy gets this - (CHUCKLES) - note tonight and you'll have the prettiest dress that money can buy. 

MAID: (DEFIANT, MOVING OFF) Let me pass, sir! I'm not giving notes to anybody! 

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... THEN FADES IN ON MOVING TRAIN INTERIOR BACKGROUND

WATSON: (READS) "The girl was frightened by his manner and she ran past him to the stable window hatch through which she always used to hand the boy his meals. The hatch was already open and the boy was waiting inside. She'd just begun to tell him what had happened when the stranger came up again."

SOUND: SCENE ABRUPTLY FADES OUT ... HORSE STABLE BACKGROUND (HORSES SNUFFLE, ET CETERA) FADES IN

STRANGER: (APPROACHES) Good evening. I wanted to have a word with you.

BOY: Er, what--? What business have you here? 

STRANGER: Business that may put something in your pocket. You've two horses in for the Wessex Cup -- Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let may have the straight tip and you won't be the loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards? 

BOY: (REALIZES, UPSET) So-- So you're one of them damn touts. Well, I'll show you how we serve them at King's Pyland. Just wait till I set the dog free. (CALLS) Rover! Rover!

SOUND: DOG BARKS ... SCENE FADES OUT ... THEN FADE IN MOVING TRAIN INTERIOR BACKGROUND

WATSON: (READS) "The boy ran to unleash the dog and the maid hurried towards the house. But, looking back, she saw the stranger leaning in through the stable window. A minute later when Hunter rushed out with the dog, the stranger was gone." (TO HOLMES) Yes, um-- That's as far as we can get with the Morning Post, I'm afraid. Mrs. Hudson very stupidly used the other half of the paper to light the fire this morning. I - I'm sorry.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Oh, no matter, my dear fellow; the Telegraph has also covered the occurrence very fully. I have it here. 

SOUND: RUSTLE OF NEWSPAPER

HOLMES: Er-- (READS) "Hunter, on the return of his fellow grooms, sent a message up to the trainer, Straker, to tell him what had happened. Straker seems to have been vaguely uneasy about the matter, for although he'd been to bed he got up again at one o'clock in the morning telling his wife that he was going down to the stable to see if all was well. He put on a mackintosh, for it was raining heavily, and left the house." (TO WATSON) Hm! Quite a wealth of detail, my dear Watson. And here I have the notes of Mrs. Straker's statement. 

SOUND: RUSTLE OF NOTES

HOLMES: (READS) "After her husband had gone out she went back to sleep again and didn't wake until seven o'clock in the morning. Finding him still absent, she called the maid and they set off together for the stables. They found the door wide open. Inside, huddled on a chair, was Hunter in a state of complete stupor. The lads in the loft overhead had heard nothing all night, but the favorite's stall was empty and there was no sign of the trainer."

WATSON: Hunter had obviously being drugged! 

HOLMES: Undoubtedly. (READS) "Mrs. Straker and the maid left him and ran up to the moor to see whether Straker had merely taken the horse out for exercise. And so the murder was discovered." (TO WATSON) Suppose you read me the rest of Mrs. Straker's statement.

SOUND: RUSTLE OF NOTES

WATSON: Oh. Well-- Yes, here it is. Er-- (READS) "Some quarter of a mile from the stables Mrs. Straker and the maid found Straker's coat flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond, there was a bowl-shaped depression on the moor, and at the bottom of this John Straker's body was found -- his head shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon; wounded in the thigh, a long clean cut evidently inflicted by some sharp instrument. Straker had obviously tried to defend himself, for in his left hand he grasped a red and black silk cravat which was recognized by the maid as having been worn by the stranger who'd spoken to her outside the stables. Hunter, the stable boy, also identified it when he'd recovered from the effects of the drug. This was apparently powdered opium which had been put into his curried mutton." (TO HOLMES) Now that - that explains what the stranger was doing as he leant through the stable window--

HOLMES: (AGREES) Mm hm. 

WATSON: --for the lads who et the same meal at the trainer's house were quite all right, so only one plate had been drugged. It goes on to say there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that the missing horse, Silver Blaze, had been there at the time of the struggle. 

HOLMES: Well, Watson, that has passed our little journey quite agreeably. And here we are at Tavistock. 

SOUND: TRAIN PULLS TO A STOP ... PASSENGERS BUSTLE ... SCENE FADES OUT

WATSON: (NARRATES) Tavistock lies like the boss of a shield in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were waiting for us at the station -- Silver Blaze's owner, the well-known sportsman Colonel Ross, and Inspector Gregory of Scotland Yard. 

COLONEL: I'm delighted that you've come down, Mr. Holmes. The inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and recover my horse.

HOLMES: I trust that I may be able to assist you, sir. Has there been any fresh development?

INSPECTOR: I'm sorry to say we've made very little progress. As you know, we've had no difficulty in tracing the stranger. He was well known in the neighborhood. His name is, er, Fitzroy Simpson, a man who's come down in the world and, er, lives by a little quiet and genteel bookmaking in the London clubs. His books showed he was carrying bets up to five thousand pounds against the favorite. When confronted with the cravat he turned very pale and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man.

WATSON: Of course Straker himself was wounded, wasn't he? In the thigh. He may have wounded himself in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury. 

HOLMES: Excellent, my dear Watson. It's more than possible; it's probable. In which case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears. 

WATSON: (NARRATES) A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau and were rolling through the quaint old Devonshire town. 

SOUND: FADE IN CLIP-CLOP OF HORSE AND MOVING LANDAU BACKGROUND

HOLMES: (TO INSPECTOR) A clever counsel would tear your case to rags. Why should Simpson take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it, he could do it there. Has a duplicate key to the stable door been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he -- he, a stranger to the district -- hide a horse? And such a horse as this! (BEAT) Tell me, what is his own explanation as to the note which he wished the maid to give to the stable boy? 

INSPECTOR: He says it was a ten-pound note, and one was found in his purse. Also, he's not a stranger to the district; he's twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The opium he probably brought with him from London. The key, having served its term, will be hurled away. As for the horse, he may well lie at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.

HOLMES: What does he say about the cravat?

INSPECTOR: He admits that it's his and says that he lost it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stables. We found traces that show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone. Simpson may well have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken.

HOLMES: Mmm, it's certainly possible. 

INSPECTOR: Eh, the moor is being scoured for them. Meanwhile I've examined every stable and outhouse in Tavistock and for a radius of ten miles. 

HOLMES: There's another training stable quite close, I believe. 

INSPECTOR: Yes, and that's a factor we must certainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of Silver Blaze. Silas Brown, their trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event and he was no friend to poor Straker. However, we've examined his stables and there's nothing to connect him with the affair.

HOLMES: And nothing to connect Fitzroy Simpson with their interests?

INSPECTOR: Nothing at all. Ah, well, here we are. 

SOUND: LANDAU PULLS TO A STOP

WATSON: (NARRATES) Our driver pulled up at a little red-brick villa which stood by the road. Colonel Ross asked Holmes whether he would like to go on to the scene of the crime.

HOLMES: No, I think I prefer to stay here a little while and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I suppose. 

COLONEL: Yes, he lies upstairs. The inquest is tomorrow.

HOLMES: He's been in your service some years, Colonel? 

COLONEL: I've always found him an excellent servant. 

HOLMES: I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, Inspector? 

INSPECTOR: I have the things themselves here in the sitting room. 

HOLMES: Aha.

SOUND: SITTING-ROOM DOOR OPENS ... THEIR STEPS IN ... ITEMS HANDLED BEHIND--

INSPECTOR: Here they are. A box of matches, two inches of tallow candle, pencil case, a few papers, and the ivory-handled knife. 

HOLMES: Yea. A very singular knife, Watson. Surely in your line.

WATSON: It's what we call a cataract knife. We use it for surgical purposes, including very delicate operations. 

HOLMES: A strange thing for a man to carry with him on a rough expedition. Why, it won't even shut up to go into his pocket.

INSPECTOR: Er, the tip was guarded by a cork which we found beside his body. His wife tells us that he kept it for some days on the dressing table and picked it up as he left the room. A poor weapon, but perhaps the best he could lay his hands on at the moment. 

HOLMES: And the papers? 

SOUND: SHUFFLE OF PAPERS IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

INSPECTOR: Hay-dealers' accounts. This letter from Colonel Ross. And this dressmaker's account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen, made out by Madame Lesurier of Bond Street. 

HOLMES: May I see that bill, please? 

INSPECTOR: Certainly. It's made out to William Derbyshire. 

HOLMES: William Derbyshire? 

INSPECTOR: Mrs. Straker tells us he was a friend of her husband's and that occasionally letters for him were addressed here. 

HOLMES: Had he been staying here then? Did Mrs. Straker know him? 

INSPECTOR: I gather not, but, er-- Here is Mrs. Straker. (INTRODUCTIONS) Er, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Mrs. Straker. 

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, MRS. STRAKER'S STEPS APPROACH

MRS. STRAKER: How do you do, sir? 

HOLMES: How do you do, Mrs. Straker? Surely we've met before. At a garden party in Plymouth recently. 

MRS. STRAKER: No, sir. You must be mistaken.

HOLMES: Dear me, I could have sworn it. You wore a costume of dove-colored silk with ostrich feather trimmings. 

MRS. STRAKER: Never had such a dress, sir. 

HOLMES: Oh. Well, that settles it then. 

MRS. STRAKER: If you'll excuse me, sir, I'd like a word with the colonel. 

HOLMES: Of course.

COLONEL: (MOVING OFF) I'll be with you in a moment, Mr. Holmes. Oh, Inspector--

SOUND: DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS OF COLONEL, INSPECTOR, AND MRS. STRAKER

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES)

WATSON: Holmes, I believe you've got your hand on a clue. 

HOLMES: Oh, do you? As a matter of fact, I was just remembering a really excellent curry we once et together in Soho.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... SOLO VIOLIN

WATSON: (NARRATES) Sherlock Holmes next asked to be shown the spot where the murder had been committed. A short walk across the moor brought us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the furze-bush upon which the mackintosh belonging to the murdered man had been hung.

SOUND: WIND BLOWS, IN BG

HOLMES: There was no wind that night, I understand. 

INSPECTOR: None; but very heavy rain.

HOLMES: Well, in that case the coat was not blown against the furze-bushes. It must have been placed there. 

INSPECTOR: Yes, it was laid across the bush.

HOLMES: Very interesting.

INSPECTOR: In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson's shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.

HOLMES: (IMPRESSED) My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself. 

WATSON: (NARRATES) Holmes took the bag and, descending into the hollow, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him. 

HOLMES: Hullo! What's this? A spent match, eh? Excellent. 

INSPECTOR: (ANNOYED) I can't think how I came to miss it! 

HOLMES: It was invisible; buried in the mud. I only found it because I was looking for it. 

INSPECTOR: What? You expected to find it?

HOLMES: I thought it not unlikely. You'll have searched the ferns around the rim of the hollow for any more tracks, of course. 

INSPECTOR: I'm afraid there are none. I've examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.

HOLMES: Good. Then I'll take a little walk over the moors before it grows dark, and I think I'll put this horseshoe in my pocket - just for luck. 

COLONEL: (PUZZLED) I - I suppose you know your own methods best, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps you'll come back with me, Inspector. There are several matters on which I need your advice. Especially as to whether we owe it to the public to scratch Silver Blaze from the Wessex Cup. 

HOLMES: Certainly not, Colonel! I should let the name stand. 

COLONEL: (SURPRISED) I am very glad to have your opinion, sir. We shall see you later on when you've finished your walk. 

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT

WATSON: (NARRATES) Colonel Ross and the inspector went back to the villa, whilst Holmes I walked slowly across the moor.

SOUND: WIND BLOWS, IN BG

HOLMES: We may leave the question of who killed John Straker for the moment and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now, supposing he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have got to?

WATSON: Almost anywhere on Dartmoor I should imagine. 

HOLMES: Oh, dear, no. The horse is a gregarious animal. If left to himself, his instincts would have been either to return to King's Pyland or go on over to Capleton yonder. Why should he run wild upon the moor? As he's not at King's Pyland, he must be over there - at Capleton! Come along. 

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT

WATSON: (NARRATES) We'd not far to go, and as we approached the gates of Capleton, we met a groom coming out of them. 

SOUND: STABLE BACKGROUND (HORSES NEIGH, ET CETERA)

GROOM: We don't want any loiterers around here! 

HOLMES: I only wanted to ask you a question. Would I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call here at five o'clock tomorrow morning? 

GROOM: Oy, bless you, sir. If anyone's about, it'll be him. He's always the first stirring.

SOUND: BROWN'S STEPS APPROACH AND GROOM'S DEPART BEHIND--

BROWN: (ANGRY) What's this, Dawson? No gossiping! Go on about your business! (TO HOLMES) And you there! What the devil do you want here?!

HOLMES: Ten minutes talk with you, my good sir. 

BROWN: Well, I've no time to talk to every gadabout. And we don't want strangers here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.

HOLMES: One word in your ear, my friend. In your own interest. (WHISPERS INDECIPHERABLY FOR A FEW SECONDS) 

BROWN: (EXPLODES) It's a lie! An infernal lie! 

HOLMES: Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlor? Or do I go to the police? 

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT

WATSON: (NARRATES) It was twenty minutes before he returned.

SOUND: WIND BLOWS, IN BG

BROWN: (UTTERLY OBSEQUIOUS) It shall be done, sir, just as you wish it. 

HOLMES: There must be no mistake. 

BROWN: Oh, no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I change it first or not? 

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) No, no, don't. I'll write to you about that. No tricks now! 

BROWN: Oh, no -- you can trust me. You can trust me.

HOLMES: Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me tomorrow. Good day to you. 

BROWN: Good day, sir. 

SOUND: BROWN'S STEPS AWAY

HOLMES: You see, Watson? A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with.

WATSON: He has the horse, then?

HOLMES: Oh, he tried to bluster it out, but I told him so exactly what his actions had been that morning that he's convinced I was actually watching him. (CHUCKLES) He was first down as usual and, seeing a strange horse wandering on the moor, he went out to it. When he recognized it as Silver Blaze -- from the white splash on its forehead -- his first instinct was to return it to the King's Pyland stable, which he set out to do. But then he realized that if the horse could only be hidden till after the Wessex Cup, his own horse Desborough would almost certainly win, so he changed his mind and turned back halfway; brought Silver Blaze down to his own stables. 

WATSON: But I thought his stables had been thoroughly searched. 

HOLMES: (DISMISSIVE, AMUSED) Oh, an old horse-fakir like him has many a dodge.

WATSON: Ah, but aren't you afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?

HOLMES: My dear fellow, he'll guard it like the apple of his eye. He knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safely at the racetrack for the Wessex Cup. I made that perfectly clear to him. But I have a little trick to play on Colonel Ross. You may have noticed that his manner to me was just a trifle cavalier. So neither of us, please, for the present will say anything to him about the horse.

WATSON: Well, certainly not, if you wish it. 

HOLMES: And of course this is all quite a minor matter compared with the question of who killed John Straker.

WATSON: And you will devote yourself to that in the meantime? 

HOLMES: On the contrary. We'll both go back to London by the night train. 

SOUND: WIND OUT

WATSON: (NARRATES) I was thunderstruck by my friend's words. We'd only been a few hours in Devonshire. That he should give up an investigation which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. Not one word more could I draw from him until we were back at the trainer's house where the colonel and the inspector were waiting for us. 

HOLMES: My friend and I return to town by the midnight-express. We've had a charming little breath of your Dartmoor air. 

COLONEL: So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker? 

HOLMES: There are certainly grave difficulties in the way. I have every hope, however, that your horse will be at the race track next Tuesday and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. Oh, may I take this photograph of John Straker with me back to town? 

SOUND: HOLMES' STEPS DEPART

COLONEL: Well, inspector, I'm rather disappointed in our London consultant. I don't see that we're any further than when he came.

WATSON: At least your have his assurance that your horse will run next week.

COLONEL: Yes, I have his assurance. I should prefer to have my horse! 

WATSON: (NARRATES) We went outside.

HOLMES: Goodbye. Goodbye, colonel! I hope to see you at the Wessex Cup -- and Silver Blaze. [Goodbye, Inspector.

INSPECTOR: (TROUBLED) But, Mr. Holmes, isn't there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?

HOLMES: To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.

INSPECTOR: (PUZZLED) The dog did nothing in the night-time.

HOLMES: That was the curious incident.]

SOUND: HORSE AND CARRIAGE DEPART ... SCENE FADES OUT ... FADE IN RACETRACK BACKGROUND BEHIND--

WATSON: (NARRATES) Four days later Holmes and I saw Silver Blaze win the Wessex Cup by a good six lengths. But it was not a Silver Blaze that even its owner could recognize. There was no trace to be seen of the famous white splash on its forehead, or of the mottled off-foreleg. The Silver Blaze that won the Wessex Cup was a powerful bay. It was only in the weighing enclosure after the race that Holmes began to explain -- to a colonel who was completely bewildered. 

HOLMES: (LAUGHS) You've only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine and you will find that he's just the same old Silver Blaze as ever. 

COLONEL: (STUNNED) You - you take my breath away.

HOLMES: Yes, I found him in the hands of a fakir, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over. 

COLONEL: My dear sir, you've done wonders! I owe you a thousand apologies! You've done me a very great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker. 

HOLMES: (QUIETLY) I have done so. 

COLONEL: You've done so?! 

WATSON: You've got him?! 

COLONEL: But where is he, then?

WATSON: What--? 

HOLMES: He's in our company at the present moment.

COLONEL: (BEAT, UNHAPPY) That is either a very bad joke, Mr. Holmes-- Or is it an insult? 

HOLMES: I am not referring to you, Colonel. The real murderer is standing immediately before you.

SOUND: HOLMES PATS THE HORSE AFFECTIONATELY TWICE 

COLONEL: The horse?! 

HOLMES: Yes, the horse. Silver Blaze himself. (BEAT) It may lessen the guilt somewhat if I say that the killing was done entirely in self-defense and that John Straker was a man who was quite unworthy of your confidence. 

SOUND: BELL RINGS, OFF

HOLMES: There goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little on the next race, I shall defer a lengthier explanation till a more fitting time.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... SOLO VIOLIN ... THEN BEHIND WATSON--

WATSON: (NARRATES) It was not until we were on our way back to London that Holmes would get down to these explanations despite the impatience of both the colonel and myself. 

SOUND: MOVING TRAIN INTERIOR BACKGROUND

HOLMES: I must confess that I even suspected Fitzroy Simpson myself for a time. It was only when I reached the trainer's house that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. 

COLONEL: The curried mutton? 

WATSON: You mean when you mentioned our Soho meal? 

HOLMES: Exactly. Powdered opium has a disagreeable and perceptible flavor. Only something more strongly flavored -- like a curry -- could have disguised the taste. Now, Fitzroy Simpson could never have known that the maid would be serving the stable lad with a curry that night. The only people who could have known that were people in the house. So who could have taken advantage of the fact? Then there was the silence of the dog when the horse was taken from the stable. It failed to bark because it knew who the intruder was. I was already quite convinced that the intruder must have been John Straker himself. 

COLONEL: John Straker himself?

WATSON: But why did he wish to take Silver Blaze out onto the moor in the dead of night, and secretly? 

HOLMES: The answer to that was in John Straker's pocket. 

WATSON: The dressmaker's bill? 

HOLMES: Precisely. Addressed to William Derbyshire. That set me thinking. Perhaps John Straker was leading a double life. After all, his wife confirmed that the expensive costume wasn't for her, and by recognizing the photo that I showed her, Madame Lesurier, the dressmaker, later confirmed that John Straker had indeed bought it there -- to give to a woman of more expensive tastes than his wife.

WATSON: In fact John Straker was leading a double life and was in bad financial straits. 

COLONEL: John Straker?! I can scarcely believe it! 

HOLMES: The knife gave me the final clue. It was a surgical knife -- such as could be used to lame a horse without leaving any visible evidence of foul play. By laming Silver Blaze and betting on Desborough, John Straker would have been able to retrieve his fortune.

COLONEL: Oh, the scoundrel! A man I trusted! 

HOLMES: He led the horse out onto the moor so that when he cut its tendon its plunging wouldn't waken the grooms overhead. In order that he could see what he was going to do, he needed a candle. So that the candle should not be seen, he led the horse to the hollow. In lighting the candle, he dropped that spent match in the mud. Unfortunately for him, the light must have scared the horse -- unless it was instinct. Whichever it was, the horse lashed out and its steel shoe caught Straker full in the forehead. He'd already taken off his mackintosh to be freer -- and, as he fell, gashed his thigh on his own knife. 

COLONEL: (ASTONISHED) But, my dear fellow, you - you might have been there. Wonderful! 

WATSON: And the cravat? Fitzroy Simpson's, which was in the dead man's hand. 

HOLMES: Simpson said that he lost it; no doubt he did. Straker must have found it and picked it up, perhaps with the idea of using it to secure the horse's leg. Well, that disposes of everything. Quite simple. Perhaps we could while away the rest of this journey, my dear Watson, with a game of chess.
